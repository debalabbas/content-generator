In the world of entrepreneurship, if you take your foot off the gas, you don't stay neutral.

You move in reverse.

You always need to be learning and taking action.

But the conventional approach to learning has us clinging onto friends, peers, colleagues, bosses, experts, influencers, and anyone else we think might lead us to the promised land.

We sit, waiting to be spoon-fed the "secrets" to success.

But that doesn't work.

I remember when I started as a solopreneur, feeling completely overwhelmed by the amount of stuff I'd need to know to run a basic business.

Everyone I talked to seemed to have a golden path, but their advice usually left me stuck in the same place, waiting for someone else to unlock the doors of wisdom.

I learned a pretty important lesson in that first year:

It's critical to take control of our learning and steer ourselves toward success.

It's the opposite of traditional business culture that conditions us to ask permission, wait our turn, stay in line, and eventually be told what to do. That kind of culture is stagnant and frustrating. And it's the opposite of how you'll need to act as a solopreneur or entrepreneur.

It's called being "auto-didactic": having self-determination and enthusiasm for learning on your own.

And it's never been more important.

Choose what to learn, set your own pace, and tailor the learning experience to your specific needs. No more waiting in line for someone to hand you the keys to knowledge.

Because time is your most valuable asset, you can't waste it.

You might ask, "Can I teach myself everything?" No, probably not everything. But you'll be amazed by how much you can learn independently.

When I started writing on LinkedIn in 2018, nobody was using it like they do today.

I thought that was a massive opportunity, so I taught myself how to use LinkedIn like a content creator and turned it into the LinkedIn operating system that 23,000 people use today.

When I couldn't figure out how to generate revenue from my content, I experimented for 6 months until I created a complete content operating system that still drives my business revenue today.

The satisfaction of mastering these skills or overcoming a business challenge on your own is f*cking awesome.

It builds a sense of confidence, self-reliance, creativity, and determination that no corporate job will ever teach you.

I'm not saying there's no value in the corporate learning structure. There is. But those methods only get you so far. When you're out on your own, conservative learning habits must be squashed.

In a world that's constantly changing, waiting for someone else to teach you means you move in reverse. You get left behind.

So, are you ready to step out of the shadows of conventional learning and embrace the power of auto-didacticism?

There's never been a better time to start than today.

Find something you want to learn. Be proactive. Be resourceful. Be determined to find the answer on your own.

The tools you need to succeed are all within reach – if only you dare to grab them.

And when you learn to teach yourself, your opportunity for growth is immense. And your education is in your hands.

What's stopping you?
