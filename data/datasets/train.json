Make that platform your primary focus.This could be Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, TikTok, or LinkedIn, to name a few.I started on LinkedIn in 2019 and found that people really resonated with my content there. After a few years of building my presence, I branched out to Twitter.If you want to see the exact system I used to go from 2k to 400k+ followers and $4M+ in income with zero paid ads, check out The LinkedIn Operating System.Content formatDifferent platforms cater to different content formats.For example, Instagram is all about visuals.Twitter thrives on snappy text updates.People like to go to TikTok for short, entertaining videos.Consider the type of content you enjoy creating and are good at producing. Then, pick a platform that aligns with your strengths.Business goalsYour primary platform should also support your business objectives.If your goal is to drive website traffic, a platform like Pinterest could be a great fit.But if you're looking to build brand awareness, Instagram or TikTok could be the way to go.Competitive landscapeAnalyze your competition and see where they're most active.It's important to be present where your competitors are. But also consider platforms where there's less competition and more opportunities to stand out.This was actually one of the ways I grew so fast on LinkedIn.I saw that people weren't doing what I was doing, so I doubled down on it.The rest is history.Ease of use and resourcesTime and resources are precious for solopreneurs.Choose a platform you're comfortable using and make sure it doesn't require a steep learning curve or expensive tools to manage.This way, you'll be able to hit the ground running.Step #3: Set clear, measurable goalsLet's be real: Without clear, measurable goals, your social media marketing efforts will be like shooting in the dark.You might hit the target occasionally, but you'll waste heaps of time and energy along the way.Let's talk about setting goals that will keep you focused, motivated, and on track to achieve the success you deserve.SpecificYour goals should be well-defined and leave no room for ambiguity.Instead of setting a vague goal like \"increase engagement,\" go for something more concrete like \"increase the average number of comments per post by 25% in 3 months.\"MeasurableTo track your progress and know when you've achieved your goals, they must be quantifiable.Measure your success with metrics like:LikesSharesFollowersCommentsEmail signupsWebsite trafficLeads generatedAchievableWhile it's great to aim high, setting unrealistic goals can be demoralizing and counterproductive.Make your goals challenging yet attainable, considering your available resources and the current state of your social media presence.RelevantCraft your social media goals around your business objectives.If your primary goal is generating leads, focus on social media goals that support that. This may include growing your email list or driving traffic to your website.Time-boundGive your goals a definitive deadline. Having that sense of urgency keeps you accountable.Deadlines have helped me prioritize tasks, stay focused, and maintain momentum.Step #4: Create a content strategyYour content strategy is the blueprint for consistent, high-impact content. It keeps you organized and laser-focused on delivering value to your audience.I suggest developing a content roadmap that outlines the:Types of content you'll createTopics you'll coverPosting frequencyWhat types of content should I create?Consider a mix of promotional, educational, and engaging content to keep your audience interested and coming back for more.This could include blog posts, videos, images, podcasts, or live streams.Pick the ones that work best on your primary platform.For me, that's text-only posts on LinkedIn. But recently, I've been seeing more people create and share videos there as well.For more information on building a better, faster content production system, check out The Content Operating System and join over 6,000 students.What topics should I cover?The themes to cover in your content should match your target audience's interests and pain points and also your business offerings.For example, if you're a fitness coach, your content themes could be:Workout tipsIndustry trendsNutrition adviceClient testimonialsMotivational storiesPro tip: Aim for a good balance between promotional and non-promotional posts.When in doubt, follow the 80/20 rule.80% of your content should be educational or entertaining. The remaining 20% can be promotional.With this approach, you'll build rapport with your audience and avoid coming across as overly salesy.How often should a solopreneur post on social media?As a general rule of thumb, I tell people to go for consistency over quantity.It's better to put out high-quality content every time you post than to overwhelm yourself by trying to post daily.For example, you might start with a content calendar of 3 posts per week. From there, you can adjust your schedule based on your results and capacity.Step #5: Develop a consistent brand voiceChances are, you've seen a post online and thought, \"I knew this was written by so-and-so before I even saw their name attached to it.\"This is what you should be striving for when writing social media content.Your brand voice is more than just the words you use.It's personality, tone, and style that infuse every piece of content you create.A consistent brand voice not only helps you stand out from the competition but also fosters a connection with your audience.To develop your own brand voice, ask yourself these questions:How do I want others to perceive me and my brand?Am I authoritative and professional, or casual and approachable?Do I want to be witty and entertaining, or serious and informative?Think about the image you want to project, then choose 3-5 adjectives that best describe your brand personality.Step #6: Establish a distinct visual identityA picture is worth a thousand words. And in the world of social media, a strong visual identity can make all the difference.Your visual identity is the collection of colors, fonts, images, and design elements that represent your brand and set you apart from the competition.Here are some things to think about when coming up with your visual style:Set the stageConsider your brand's personality and the emotions you want to evoke with your visuals.Are you going for a bold, modern look or a warm, vintage vibe?Think about what your target market would like to see and how your visual style can connect with them more deeply.Choose your color paletteColors not only evoke emotions but also help reinforce your brand's personality.Choose 2-3 primary colors and 1-2 accent colors that work with your brand. Then, use these colors consistently across all your content and marketing materials.Select your fontsTypography plays a significant role in communicating your brand's message.Choose 1-2 fonts that complement your brand's personality and are easy to read. Stick to these fonts for all your content, from social media captions to blog posts.Create branded templatesSave time and maintain consistency by making branded templates for your social media posts, blog images, and other marketing materials.Then, use your chosen color palette, fonts, and design elements to make templates that you can easily customize for various content types and topics.For example, if you go to the newsletter section of my website, you'll see that all the featured images have a uniform look:This makes my brand more recognizable and memorable.Step #7: Engage with your audienceEngagement is the name of the social media game.It's not enough to simply post content and hope for the best.You need to actively engage with people to build authentic relationships, foster loyalty, and create a thriving online community.Here are some ways I make my audience feel valued and heard (and you can too):Respond to comments and messagesMake it a priority to respond to comments and messages from your audience in a timely manner.Whether it's answering a question, addressing a concern, or simply expressing gratitude for their support, your personal touch will go a long way in building trust.Ask for feedback and opinionsShow your audience that you value their thoughts by actively seeking their input.Ask questions in your social media captions, create polls, or host Q&A sessions to encourage engagement.This is also a fantastic way to gather valuable insights that can help you improve your content and offerings.Keep the conversation goingDon't let the engagement end with a single comment or message.Continue the conversation by asking follow-up questions, sharing additional resources, or simply showing genuine interest in people's thoughts and experiences.Step #8: Analyze and optimizeIn the ever-evolving landscape of social media, staying ahead of the curve requires constant strategy analysis and optimization.Every quarter, I like to reflect and study what worked well (and what didn't). From there, I'll adjust my strategy to get more wins next quarter.Keep in mind that what works for one person may not work for you. So, don't be afraid to find your groove by testing new ideas and content formats.By adopting an analytical and iterative mindset, you'll set yourself up for continuous growth and success on social media.Get started with social media as a solopreneurIn summary, having a strong social media presence is essential for solopreneurs and small businesses.The good news is:There's no shortage of tactics to build a powerful social media strategy.You just need to identify your goals, understand your audience, and stay committed to the process.Want to grow your online presence and attract a loyal community?Curate compelling content.

It keeps you organized and laser-focused on delivering value to your audience.I suggest developing a content roadmap that outlines the:Types of content you'll createTopics you'll coverPosting frequencyWhat types of content should I create?Consider a mix of promotional, educational, and engaging content to keep your audience interested and coming back for more.This could include blog posts, videos, images, podcasts, or live streams.Pick the ones that work best on your primary platform.For me, that's text-only posts on LinkedIn. But recently, I've been seeing more people create and share videos there as well.For more information on building a better, faster content production system, check out The Content Operating System and join over 6,000 students.What topics should I cover?The themes to cover in your content should match your target audience's interests and pain points and also your business offerings.For example, if you're a fitness coach, your content themes could be:Workout tipsIndustry trendsNutrition adviceClient testimonialsMotivational storiesPro tip: Aim for a good balance between promotional and non-promotional posts.When in doubt, follow the 80/20 rule.80% of your content should be educational or entertaining. The remaining 20% can be promotional.With this approach, you'll build rapport with your audience and avoid coming across as overly salesy.How often should a solopreneur post on social media?As a general rule of thumb, I tell people to go for consistency over quantity.It's better to put out high-quality content every time you post than to overwhelm yourself by trying to post daily.For example, you might start with a content calendar of 3 posts per week. From there, you can adjust your schedule based on your results and capacity.Step #5: Develop a consistent brand voiceChances are, you've seen a post online and thought, \"I knew this was written by so-and-so before I even saw their name attached to it.\"This is what you should be striving for when writing social media content.Your brand voice is more than just the words you use.It's personality, tone, and style that infuse every piece of content you create.A consistent brand voice not only helps you stand out from the competition but also fosters a connection with your audience.To develop your own brand voice, ask yourself these questions:How do I want others to perceive me and my brand?Am I authoritative and professional, or casual and approachable?Do I want to be witty and entertaining, or serious and informative?Think about the image you want to project, then choose 3-5 adjectives that best describe your brand personality.Step #6: Establish a distinct visual identityA picture is worth a thousand words. And in the world of social media, a strong visual identity can make all the difference.Your visual identity is the collection of colors, fonts, images, and design elements that represent your brand and set you apart from the competition.Here are some things to think about when coming up with your visual style:Set the stageConsider your brand's personality and the emotions you want to evoke with your visuals.Are you going for a bold, modern look or a warm, vintage vibe?Think about what your target market would like to see and how your visual style can connect with them more deeply.Choose your color paletteColors not only evoke emotions but also help reinforce your brand's personality.Choose 2-3 primary colors and 1-2 accent colors that work with your brand. Then, use these colors consistently across all your content and marketing materials.Select your fontsTypography plays a significant role in communicating your brand's message.Choose 1-2 fonts that complement your brand's personality and are easy to read. Stick to these fonts for all your content, from social media captions to blog posts.Create branded templatesSave time and maintain consistency by making branded templates for your social media posts, blog images, and other marketing materials.Then, use your chosen color palette, fonts, and design elements to make templates that you can easily customize for various content types and topics.For example, if you go to the newsletter section of my website, you'll see that all the featured images have a uniform look:This makes my brand more recognizable and memorable.Step #7: Engage with your audienceEngagement is the name of the social media game.It's not enough to simply post content and hope for the best.You need to actively engage with people to build authentic relationships, foster loyalty, and create a thriving online community.Here are some ways I make my audience feel valued and heard (and you can too):Respond to comments and messagesMake it a priority to respond to comments and messages from your audience in a timely manner.Whether it's answering a question, addressing a concern, or simply expressing gratitude for their support, your personal touch will go a long way in building trust.Ask for feedback and opinionsShow your audience that you value their thoughts by actively seeking their input.Ask questions in your social media captions, create polls, or host Q&A sessions to encourage engagement.This is also a fantastic way to gather valuable insights that can help you improve your content and offerings.Keep the conversation goingDon't let the engagement end with a single comment or message.Continue the conversation by asking follow-up questions, sharing additional resources, or simply showing genuine interest in people's thoughts and experiences.Step #8: Analyze and optimizeIn the ever-evolving landscape of social media, staying ahead of the curve requires constant strategy analysis and optimization.Every quarter, I like to reflect and study what worked well (and what didn't). From there, I'll adjust my strategy to get more wins next quarter.Keep in mind that what works for one person may not work for you. So, don't be afraid to find your groove by testing new ideas and content formats.By adopting an analytical and iterative mindset, you'll set yourself up for continuous growth and success on social media.Get started with social media as a solopreneurIn summary, having a strong social media presence is essential for solopreneurs and small businesses.The good news is:There's no shortage of tactics to build a powerful social media strategy.You just need to identify your goals, understand your audience, and stay committed to the process.Want to grow your online presence and attract a loyal community?Curate compelling content.

That kind of culture is stagnant and frustrating. And it's the opposite of how you'll need to act as a solopreneur or entrepreneur.It's called being \"auto-didactic\": having self-determination and enthusiasm for learning on your own.And it's never been more important.Choose what to learn, set your own pace, and tailor the learning experience to your specific needs. No more waiting in line for someone to hand you the keys to knowledge.Because time is your most valuable asset, you can't waste it.You might ask, \"Can I teach myself everything?\" No, probably not everything. But you'll be amazed by how much you can learn independently.When I started writing on LinkedIn in 2018, nobody was using it like they do today.I thought that was a massive opportunity, so I taught myself how to use LinkedIn like a content creator and turned it into the LinkedIn operating system that 23,000 people use today.When I couldn't figure out how to generate revenue from my content, I experimented for 6 months until I created a complete content operating system that still drives my business revenue today.The satisfaction of mastering these skills or overcoming a business challenge on your own is f*cking awesome.It builds a sense of confidence, self-reliance, creativity, and determination that no corporate job will ever teach you.I'm not saying there's no value in the corporate learning structure.

branding tips for solopreneursContrary to what anyone tells you, success doesn\u2019t happen overnight.You're going to need to put in the work, but these strategies have helped me build my brand (and can help you do the same):Build an online presenceNetwork with others in your industryCreate a memorable visual identityShowcase your expertise with compelling contentTell stories to connect with your audienceDeliver value and exceptional customer experiencesLet's dive into each one.1. Build an online presenceHaving a strong online presence is a non-negotiable for solopreneurs today.Your online presence serves as the foundation of your brand and is often the first point of contact for potential clients.Here are a few places where you might establish your online presence:LinkedInI started posting consistently on LinkedIn in 2019, with a focus on solving people's problems.To date, it's one of my best decisions. I've met so many brilliant people and made awesome friends from all walks of life.LinkedIn is a powerful tool for networking, showcasing your expertise, and building credibility.Boost your visibility by optimizing your profile, publishing thought-provoking content, and engaging in relevant discussions.If you want to see the exact system I used to go from 2k to 450k+ followers and $4M+ in income with zero paid ads, check out The LinkedIn Operating System.Social mediaBesides LinkedIn, you can choose the social media platforms that best align with your target audience and industry.This could be Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and/or YouTube, to name a few.I suggest you pick one initially and start growing a loyal following. Once you have an audience there, slowly expand your reach on other platforms.Wherever you go, focus on building a consistent and engaging presence, sharing valuable content, and interacting with your followers.WebsiteAfter establishing your footing on social media, create a professional and user-friendly website that showcases your services, portfolio, and testimonials.Make sure it's easy to navigate, mobile-responsive, and optimized for search engines.Building a beautiful yet functional website doesn't have to be complicated or expensive. If you're on a budget, consider creating a landing page on Carrd first. Then, invest in a more robust site as your business grows.I currently use Kajabi for my website. I love that it enables me to manage everything in one place, but it's a hefty (and probably unnecessary) investment for newer solopreneurs.2.

Build an online presenceHaving a strong online presence is a non-negotiable for solopreneurs today.Your online presence serves as the foundation of your brand and is often the first point of contact for potential clients.Here are a few places where you might establish your online presence:LinkedInI started posting consistently on LinkedIn in 2019, with a focus on solving people's problems.To date, it's one of my best decisions. I've met so many brilliant people and made awesome friends from all walks of life.LinkedIn is a powerful tool for networking, showcasing your expertise, and building credibility.Boost your visibility by optimizing your profile, publishing thought-provoking content, and engaging in relevant discussions.If you want to see the exact system I used to go from 2k to 450k+ followers and $4M+ in income with zero paid ads, check out The LinkedIn Operating System.Social mediaBesides LinkedIn, you can choose the social media platforms that best align with your target audience and industry.This could be Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and/or YouTube, to name a few.I suggest you pick one initially and start growing a loyal following. Once you have an audience there, slowly expand your reach on other platforms.Wherever you go, focus on building a consistent and engaging presence, sharing valuable content, and interacting with your followers.WebsiteAfter establishing your footing on social media, create a professional and user-friendly website that showcases your services, portfolio, and testimonials.Make sure it's easy to navigate, mobile-responsive, and optimized for search engines.Building a beautiful yet functional website doesn't have to be complicated or expensive. If you're on a budget, consider creating a landing page on Carrd first. Then, invest in a more robust site as your business grows.I currently use Kajabi for my website. I love that it enables me to manage everything in one place, but it's a hefty (and probably unnecessary) investment for newer solopreneurs.2.

Showcase your expertise with compelling contentPut yourself in the shoes of your buyer.You'd only want to buy from someone who demonstrated credibility and know-how in what they do, right?Sharing valuable and engaging content is a fantastic way to show what you know and build trust with prospective buyers.By consistently publishing insightful content, you'll become an authority in your field and create opportunities for growth.Here's how I showcase my expertise:Engage with your audienceCommunity is huge when it comes to branding.Build yours by encouraging feedback, questions, and comments from your audience.A great way to do this is by closing off a post with either a question or a call to action, to initiate a response from readers.Besides posting your own content, you should also leave thoughtful comments on other people's posts.Don't worry; this doesn't have to be as time-consuming as it sounds.Create a Notion board with 3 lists of 5 people each:People with a similar following count (they're more likely to engage back on your content)Larger creators (more people will see your comments)Industry professionals (let prospects know you exist without sending tacky cold pitches)Once you have your lists, set aside 15 minutes each day to engage with these people.With time, your audience will grow and get to know what you're all about.Create a content planNeeding to make noise every day gets exhausting for many new business owners.In my 5 years of solopreneurship, I've certainly had days where I'm less motivated. But I learned that having a content strategy goes a long way in helping me overcome those days.Basically, a content strategy outlines your goals, target audience, and the types of content you'll create.This plan serves as a roadmap for your content creation efforts and ensures consistency in your messaging.When you have this plan in front of you, it becomes much easier to conquer writer's block.A content calendar may look something like this:Monday: Share industry-related practical tips and insightsTuesday: Highlight a testimonial or recent case study showing results you brought a clientWednesday: Promote your business (e.g., your offering, newsletter, podcast feature)Thursday: Start a conversation about an industry hot-take or opinionFriday: A personal story that taught you an important business lessonEveryone's content strategy is different.So, get creative with yours and do what makes the most sense for your business.Choose the right formatsSimilar to content strategy, the best content formats are different for everyone. Don't be afraid to experiment with multiple to see what best resonates with your audience.I've learned that my audience enjoys short-form text posts on LinkedIn and Twitter.

I couldn't help but smirk.And I can clearly recall looking around the room and thinking, \"Am I the only one feeling this way?\"It wasn't long after that I started realizing something: real learning doesn't always come in neat packages.We learn the most when we start doing things, not hearing or reading things. Even when the teacher has \"been there, done that\", the advice given doesn't always work. Why?Because conventional wisdom isn't always wise.The Skeptic's Guide to LearningSo, what does learning look like when we throw conventional wisdom out the window?Here's what I've come up with:Question Everything: Don't accept something just because \"that's how it's always been done\". Dig deeper, challenge assumptions, and don't be afraid to ask \"Why?\" Often, the stuff being taught is 5, 10, or even 20 years old.Use Trial and Error: Failure can be one hell of a teacher. I've made tons of mistakes, and I've learned more from them than from any classroom lesson. Your journey will look different than other people's. So make your own mistakes and learn your own lessons.Find Your Own Path: Find mentors, read books, take online courses, and experiment. But you can't just seek out knowledge - you must put it into action. Create your unique learning journey by testing, analyzing, iterating, and repeating.Integrate Learning into Life: Outside of mentors, books, and online courses, make sure that you integrate learning into your daily work. Don't think of learning and working as separate. They are the same! So make sure you're setting up systems to capture what you learn as you put in the work.Changing the CultureThis approach isn't easy.It's often met with skepticism, or \"trust me, the old way works.\"But it's worth asking - are you satisfied with the status quo around learning and development? Are you content with simply going through the motions of another workshop or training program?There's a better way. A way that incorporates individuality, curiosity, and the entrepreneurial spirit that drives each of us.It's about owning your learning, taking control, and not being dedicated to the best practices of the business world.Instead, maybe it's time you created your own best practices?In SummaryThe conventional learning path may be comfortable, but I don't find it useful.

Generally, it works like this:Broad audience \u2192 niche \u2192 sub-nicheYou can apply this formula to the audience you\u2019re looking to attract.For example, let\u2019s say you're a personal trainer looking to build an online coaching business.Rather than targeting athletes (broad audience), or runners (niche), you could focus specifically on marathon runners (sub-niche).This example assumes you have deep knowledge of marathon running and can speak intelligently about the topic.Method 2: Choosing a sub-niche by product or serviceYou can also apply this to the product or service that you are creating to arrive at your audience.Instead of your product being a book (broad product), or a cookbook (niche), you could focus specifically on creating a vegan dessert cookbook (sub-niche).Or, rather than offering a generic service such as coaching (broad service), or leadership coaching (niche), you could focus specifically on leadership coaching for female entrepreneurs (sub-niche).The result?Once you narrow down to a sub-niche, your audience is more likely to have the same challenges, and therefore the same wants and needs.That\u2019s where you come in.Now what?Once you\u2019ve narrowed it down to your sub-niche audience, you can start learning more about them.Where do they hang out online?What jargon and language do they use?What podcasts and YouTube channels do they watch?Who is already serving this audience i.e. who are your competitors?Method 3: Creating your own \"niche of one\"The most compelling creators online are, what I call, a niche of one.A niche of one is a unique combination of skills and interests rolled into one idea and then distributed through highly creative or technical content.When you do this well, you own a micro-niche.You become the category creator.

So, now what?Let\u2019s put them together to start formulating an interesting idea.3. Idea: Combine the above twoThe idea block of a niche of one is where most people get it wrong. They let a lack of creativity keep them from building something unique.For example, we\u2019ve all had ideas before, but they end up as unfinished blog posts, abandoned podcasts, or dwindling YouTube channels.That\u2019s because the creation must be forced. You\u2019re starting from a blank canvas every morning. We\u2019re back to the same old questions:\u201cWhat do I write about today?\u201d\u201cWhat do I paint today?\"\u201cWhat do I teach today?\u201dIn a niche of one, you create one idea, and then learn how to say it, do it, or package it 1,000+ different ways.Let\u2019s use our examples from above.Example #1: You\u2019re a financial analyst and your interest is in wine.Unique idea: Use your financial knowledge to project the value of one high-end wine bottle each morning.Example #2: You're fluent in English and Portuguese and your interest is in marketing.Unique idea: Translate one of your favorite company landing pages from English to Portuguese using local dialect and slang, every day.You could easily argue that these ideas are not interesting, but you\u2019d be missing the larger point. They are one single idea that can be produced and reproduced 1000x over.The game of \u201cwhat do I do today?\u201d is now over.These ideas, when shared broadly through proper distribution, attract a natural audience of interested people.4/5. Distribution & Audience: Create a distribution systemIn order for people to discover your unique and interesting idea, they have to be able to find it. This is where distribution comes into play.Your audience is an outcome of good distribution.Having a niche of one gives you an advantage because you\u2019ve increased the number of places you can distribute.For example, if you\u2019re our financial whiz/wine lover, you can distribute on sites centered around wine, the wine exchange, finance trends, etc.I\u2019d recommend focusing on the following:Personal blog or newsletter: a place where your content can live forever and can be a catch-all for email subscribers.Social media: pick one channel and master it. Don\u2019t try to be a social media hero from the start.Industry sites: every skill and interest has industry sites. For example, I like to talk about building online, so I can find great channels on IndieHackers.Slack Channels: join private Slack communities centered around your skills or interests.By distributing routinely, a natural audience will grow.Remember, you don\u2019t pick your audience, they pick you. You simply set up a system where more people are likely to find you.If you\u2019re our finance/wine person from above, you will naturally attract an audience of people who love wine, sommeliers, and collectors.But, you\u2019re also likely to attract people who have an interest in data analysis, financial trends, the market, exchanges, and so on.6. Product: Ask your audience what they needNow comes the easiest part. Asking and listening.With an audience built around a specific, unique idea, you can simply start to ask them what would be most helpful, and listen to their answers.It\u2019s amazing how many people skip this critical step.Ask on social or send out a survey via email. What would they like to learn? What would they be happy to spend some money on?For example, some people might enjoy a digital course teaching them your method behind wine price projections.Others might want a 1:1 Zoom call where you apply your formula to bottles in their collection together, while some would likely just want to purchase a financial analysis of multiple bottles, without the video call.All of this can be placed on a value ladder that people can move up over time:SummaryIn summary, the internet is getting crowded.Picking your passion and then trying to write or record from scratch each day can be a very daunting task.The most compelling creators you see online have a system. Nobody is out here winging it.So, to get started, do the following:Pick something you excel atChoose something you're interested inCombine themCreate a distribution systemAllow an audience to formAsk them what they needThat's all for my guide on choosing a profitable niche.Thanks for reading.", "to create your \u201cNiche of One\u201dPick something you excel atChoose something you're interested inCombine themCreate a distribution systemAllow an audience to formAsk them what they need1. Skills: Something you excel atMost skills, by themselves, are not unique.Lots of people can write, speak English and Portuguese, or do financial analysis.Too often, people make the mistake of choosing a skill when deciding to create online. I\u2019m a writer, so I\u2019ll write. I\u2019m a painter, so I\u2019ll paint. I know how to do X, so I\u2019ll teach people how to do X. You get the point.The difficulty arises when the inevitable question comes up:\u201cWhat do I write about today?\u201d\u201cWhat do I paint today?\"\u201cWhat do I teach today?\u201dWhen the brain faces a creative block, people either quit creating or create something subpar. Two poor outcomes.Let\u2019s introduce interests into the equation and see what happens.2. Interests: What you're passionate aboutThis guide is not meant to be cliche. \u201cChase your dreams!\u201d. \u201cDo something you love and you\u2019ll never work a day in your life!\u201d That's all nonsense.But, interests are important.

The scenarios I imagined were pretty intimidating:ScornRidiculeMockingEmbarrassmentI look back and still don't think these fears were entirely unfounded.Some of them did happen.But as time went on, they became blips on my radar, fading into the background of this journey marked by growth and discovery. When I talk to my wife about nasty comments and trolls, I can't even remember who they were or what they said.There's a lesson in there.The Leap to ActionIt's easy to read about starting something. It's natural to dream about it. It's even common to make elaborate plans to get started.But none of that compares to the simple, powerful act of just starting.When we allow our fears to dictate our actions, we miss out on big opportunities.The worst thing that happens when we take a chance is that our life stays the same. But the best thing? Our life changes for good, forever.So, how do you actually start? What's the tactical plan for moving from dreamer to doer?Here are two steps that helped me.Two Action Steps to Get Started Today1. Map Your Fear LandscapeWrite down your specific fears and anxieties about putting yourself out there. Next to each, write down a rational response or a way to overcome that fear.Sometimes, simply acknowledging these fears can diminish their power over you.For example: \"I'm afraid that someone will say something nasty to me\" is reframed to: \"For every person who says something nasty, it's likely that 99 will say something kind.\"2. Set a 30-Day Challenge with Public AccountabilityCommit to a small daily action related to your goal for the next 30 days.

It's changed his whole life in 60 days.The Path ForwardThe path of the solopreneur is filled with unique challenges and occasional setbacks.But it also offers the potential for something truly remarkable.
