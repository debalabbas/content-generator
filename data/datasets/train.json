["Ever wonder why companies want you to come back to the office? \n \nOr spend all day at your desk? \n \nMe too. \n \nSure...I understand the camaraderie. \n \nOr teamwork. \n \nAnd some things are more easily done in person than virtually. I get that. \n \nBut here's something else I think: \n \nSuccess is not about long hours in the office. Or sitting at your desk from 9 to 5. \n \nIt's about good ideas and sharp execution. \n \nAnd sometimes, the best ideas come when you're away from your desk. \n \nLike at the dinner table, on a run, or playing with your kids. \n \nSpending time with family isn't just nice, it helps us think better. \n \nDon't get stuck on the old idea that more hours at work means more success. \n \nTry something different. \n \nSpend more time living life, and you might find you're better at your job. \n \nMaybe a new way to measure success is in the quality of our ideas, and how we execute them - not the quantity of our hours. \n \nYour desk isn't going anywhere, but your life is. \n \nBuild life-work balance. \n \nNot the other way around. \n\n9 Entrepreneurial Lessons from the Netflix documentary, 'Sly' about Sylvester Stallone.\n\n1. Pursue your passion relentlessly:\n\n\"I am not the richest, smartest, or most talented person in the world, but I succeed because I keep going and going and going.\"\n\n2.

Have a mindset of unbridled optimism:\n\n\"I believe any success in life is made by going into an area with a blind, furious optimism.\"\n\n3. Use rejection as a motivator:\n\n\"I take rejection as someone blowing a bugle in my ear to wake me up and get going, rather than a signal to retreat.\"\n\n4. Adaptability in the Face of Challenge:\n\n\"Every time I've failed, people had me out for the count, but I always come back.\"\n\n5. Build a network of loyal people who love you:\n\n\"I learned the real meaning of love. Love is absolute loyalty. People fade, looks fade, but loyalty never fades.\"\n\n6. Develop a high level of persistence:\n\n\"It ain't about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward.\"\n\n7. Be a continuous learner:\n\n\"Remember the mind is your best muscle... Big arms can move rocks, but big words can move mountains.\"\n\n8. Don't let failure dictate your mind:\n\n\"Success is usually the culmination of controlling failure.\"\n\n9. Never stop trying to get better:\n\n\"I'm always looking for a new challenge.

Excellent at what they do. \n2. Have been doing it for a long time. \n \nSo, why are so many people trying to circumvent this equation with short-term hacks and tricks? \n \nThey won't win. \nIt rarely works. \n \nIf you want to be great at something, here's what you should focus on: \n \n1. Invest in your expertise: \n \nThis means constantly learning, growing, and challenging yourself. \n \nThe world is evolving rapidly, and those who don't keep up will quickly fall behind. If you're being cheap in your self-investment, you're making a big mistake. \n \n2. Give it time: \n \nSuccess is not an overnight phenomenon no matter how many people try to sell you this nonsense. \n \nIt's the result of consistent effort over time. \n \nGo on a journey you enjoy and understand that every step, even the setbacks, is a big part of your growth. \n \nPatience isn't just a virtue; it's a necessity. \n \nThe secret to success lies in perseverance and continuous improvement. \n \nSo, ask yourself: Are you investing in your expertise? \n \nAre you giving your journey the time it deserves? \n \nIf", "not, change it up this weekend. \n\nBecoming an entrepreneur is not about quitting your job. \n \nIt's about reinventing your whole life. \n \nWe often hear about the desire to quit and chase dreams of entrepreneurship and freedom. \n \nBut it's not easy. Or for everyone. \n \nIt's difficult to create a life where work aligns with passion, purpose, and personal growth. \n \nIf you're trying to make this transition successfully, consider these moves: \n \n1. Identify Your Core Strengths: \n \nUnderstand (specifically) what you're exceptionally good at and enjoy doing. Both of these are required for entrepreneurial longevity. \n \n2. Develop a Financial Cushion: \n \nBefore taking the leap, build a financial safety net. Try to save 6-12 months of spending cash and build your side project to 60% of your total earnings. \n \n3. Adapt Continuously: \n \nThe world of entrepreneurship is ever-evolving. Stay ahead by constantly learning new skills and keep experimenting with new content, products, networking ideas, etc. \n \n4. Build a Huge Support Network: \n \nSurround yourself with mentors, peers, and a community that supports you. That actually wants you to win. Their guidance, encouragement, and shared experiences are invaluable. \n \nIf you've made this transition, or are considering it, what else have you found to be most effective? ", "I've made over $4M in the last 4 years online, including over $2M on digital course sales in the last 2 years.\n\nI put together this free guide to share a lot of what I've learned. I'll be updating it continuously as I learn and remember more.\n\nThis guide breaks down different ways to make money online and captures learnings from my actual work, wins, and losses.\n\nIf you want updates, simply subscribe to my newsletter.\n\nPart 1: 7 ways to make money online\nPart 2: My own portfolio of online one-person businesses\nPart 3: 16 tips for making money online from what I\u2019ve learned\nI hope you find this helpful.\n\nDon't overcomplicate making money online\nMost people want to make money online, but they make the process harder than it needs to be.\n\nThis can prevent them from getting started at all.\n\nAfter building a portfolio of one-person businesses to over $4M in revenue, I\u2019ve learned that making money online doesn't have to be complex.\n\n\nWith this in mind, let's dive into 7 possible income streams to make your first dollar on the internet.\n\n7 ways to make money online\nOffer your skill as a service\nCreate and sell digital products\nOffer Software as a Service (SaaS)\nDo cohort-based coaching\nMonetize a personal blog\nBecome a consultant\nSeek out sponsorships\n1.

Offer your skill as a service\nOne of the best ways to make money online is by selling your skill as a service.\n\nI like this method because upfront costs are low, but the earning potential is significant.\n\nLet's say you're new to solopreneurship and don't have the capital to start a traditional business, but your friends, family, and past employers have mentioned you're an excellent writer.\n\nYou can monetize that skill by selling writing services:\n\nWrite ad copy for businesses\nGhostwrite blogs for CEOs and founders\nProduce written social media content for brands\nThe list goes on.\n\nDepending on what skill you're selling, you likely don't need much to get started. For example, freelance writers can manage with a reliable laptop and an internet connection.\n\nUpfront time investment\nBe ready to invest a full day into optimizing your LinkedIn & Twitter profiles to attract ideal clients.\n\nThen set up a service page showcasing your offering.\n\n\nDifficulty level\nThe work itself can be easy if you're great at what you do. But getting clients can be tough in the beginning.\n\nHaving an established presence and credibility helps you land gigs easier and quicker. If you have the skill but no audience, you'll need to build a social media following on one platform in the beginning.\n\nI recommend LinkedIn or Twitter for creative services like writing. But some", "service offerings may attract clients on different platforms (e.g. photography or visual design on Instagram).\n\nDon't be afraid to experiment on a few channels to see which one gets you the most traction. Once you figure that out, I'd focus on building there before branching out.\n\nBusiness ideas for service providers\nMarketing consultant\nFreelance writing\nVirtual Assistant\nGraphic design\nPhotography\nOnline tutor\nWeb design\nData entry\n2. Create and sell digital products\nMany freelancers I know eventually create digital products once they've monetized their skills over time.\n\nThis revenue stream works well if you build a personal brand while freelancing. When you share your learnings publicly online, people resonate, gain trust, and want to buy from you.\n\nIn my early days of solopreneurship, I offered consulting services to clients in the SaaS industry. While doing this, I committed to a daily writing habit and consistently showed up on LinkedIn.\n\nWhat came out of it was incredible:\n\nPeople enjoyed the content I shared\nPeople trusted me as I built authority\nPeople were intrigued by my journey\nPeople asked me questions about creating content and building a personal brand\nFrom there, I saw an opportunity to create affordable digital products.\n\nSo I packaged up everything I learned from the past 4 years of solopreneurship into 2 courses: The Operating System and The Content Operating System.\n\n\nThe Operating System is for people wanting to grow their LinkedIn presence and eventually monetize it.\n\nIn this course, I go over tips on how to:\n\nWrite compelling social media posts\nDevelop meaningful relationships\nGet inbound and outbound leads\nThe Content Operating System is for those wanting to create and scale content.\n\nThe lessons focus on the systems I use to", "produce quality content quickly \u2014 not just social media posts but also blog articles, guides, newsletters, you name it.\n\nUpfront time investment\nThe time investment comes down to what kind of digital product you're offering. A course may take a full month or more to make, while checklists and templates can be done in a day.\n\nDifficulty level\nCreating one-off digital products is generally less time-consuming than full courses. I recommend starting here if you're thinking about making money online this way.\n\nYou could create templates, checklists, and guides that sell for $10-50 on your website.\n\n\nThe beauty of selling digital products is that once they're made, you can sell them indefinitely and make passive income.\n\nBut there's a catch:\n\nYou need a loyal audience with pain points (that you can address).\n\nIf you don't have a social media following, I suggest building that before creating any digital products. The last thing you want to do is put in all the work but have no one to sell to.\n\nOnce you have the audience, it becomes much easier.\n\nWhen creating my courses, I kept things simple. The content and lessons are what people pay for, not fancy videos with an even fancier background.\n\nRemember, it's possible to produce amazing value without spending a fortune on shiny objects like an expensive microphone or editing software.\n\nDon't overthink it \u2014 just do it!\n\nDigital product ideas\nTemplates\nChecklists\nCourses\neBooks\nGuides\n3. Offer Software as a Service (SaaS)\nWhat I love most about SaaS is its recurring revenue model. Instead of a one-time sale, you're building relationships with your customers, and providing them with continuous value. In return, you", "get consistent income.\n\nImagine you notice a gap in the market. Maybe small businesses that struggle with scheduling appointments, and you think, \"Hey! I can create a simple tool to solve that.\" There's your SaaS idea.\n\nHere's how you can monetize this:\n\nCreate a subscription-based tool for appointment scheduling\nOffer a basic version for free and premium features at a cost\nSet up integrations with other popular tools to enhance functionality\nUpfront time investment\nBuilding a great SaaS product requires a significant time investment upfront. You'll need to conceptualize the software, develop it (or hire developers), and then test it rigorously.\n\nBut remember, once it's live and you've got users, the feedback loop can help you refine and improve without needing to start from scratch.\n\nDifficulty level\nI won't sugarcoat it. This isn't the easiest online business venture. Developing a SaaS product requires technical know-how or the capital to hire those who do.\n\nBut the payoff? It can be massive.\n\nBuilding an audience for your SaaS product is crucial. Platforms like Product Hunt or even LinkedIn can be goldmines for initial traction. And don't forget about content marketing \u2014 offering valuable insights related to your product niche can draw in potential users.\n\nBusiness ideas for SaaS entrepreneurs\nVirtual event platforms\nE-commerce optimization tools\nCRM systems for niche markets\nSocial media analytics platforms\nOnline booking systems for niche services\nTask automation tools for specific industries\n4. Do cohort-based coaching\nOne of the emerging trends in the online education space is cohort-based coaching.\n\nIt combines the best of both worlds: the personal touch of live coaching and the scalability of online courses.\n\nYou're essentially guiding a group of people through a", "learning journey together, fostering community and accountability.\n\nGot a knack for digital marketing? Instead of coaching people one-on-one, gather a group and take them through a structured, time-bound program.\n\nHere's how you can leverage this:\n\nDesign a 6-week program on digital marketing strategies\nIncorporate live sessions, Q&A's, and group activities\nUse platforms like Zoom or Discord for live interactions\nOffer additional resources, templates, and tools to enhance the learning experience\nUpfront time investment\nCrafting a cohort-based course requires a blend of curriculum design, content creation, and community management. This could take weeks or months, depending on how extensive you want it to be. But once it's ready, you can run the program multiple times, making minor tweaks as required.\n\nDifficulty level\nWhile it's less tech-intensive than creating a SaaS, cohort-based coaching demands strong interpersonal skills and industry expertise.\n\nOne of the main challenges is ensuring every cohort feels as engaged and valued as the last. But with the right energy and commitment, the rewards \u2014 both in terms of impact and monetary gain \u2014 can be substantial.\n\nBefore you launch your cohort-based course, focus on building a loyal audience. Platforms like LinkedIn, Twitter, or even niche-specific forums can be your best friend here. Share valuable insights, engage in discussions, and position yourself as an authority in your domain.\n\nCohort-based coaching business ideas\nCreative writing workshops\nDigital marketing boot camps\nEntrepreneurship and startup masterclasses\nHealth and wellness transformation programs\nPersonal development and life coaching sessions\nNiche-specific skill training (e.g. podcasting, video editing, photography)\n5. Monetize a personal blog\nMany social media influencers also have personal blogs where they make extra money through advertisements, sponsorships, and affiliate marketing.\n\nFirst, you", "can display ads on your blog and earn money when people view or click on them.\n\nSponsored content is another popular way of monetizing a personal blog.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nBrands pay you a fixed amount to write a blog to promote their products or services. Often, they'll also provide a unique promotion code for you to include in the blog post. If someone makes a purchase with your code, you get a commission.\n\nBesides paid ads, sponsorships, and affiliate marketing, you can sell your own products. This could be online courses or print-on-demand goods, depending on what your audience will find valuable.\n\nUpfront time investment\nDesigning and launching a WordPress blog from scratch may take a day or a month, depending on your experience.\n\nBut after setting it up, remember that search engine optimization for new websites can take time to bear fruit.\n\nBefore thinking about monetizing, you'll need to:\n\nCreate high-quality content to rank well on search engines\nGather social proof to attract worthwhile partnerships\nBuild an audience somewhere to funnel people over to your blog\nDifficulty level\nIf you enjoy writing online, then running a personal blog may be your next passion project.\n\nBut that doesn't mean it'll be easy. Blogging involves more than just creating content.\n\nIf you're only good at writing, you may need help in other areas:\n\nTroubleshooting\nOptimizing site speed\nEnsuring mobile-friendliness\nWebsite design and graphics\nBlogging business ideas\nPaid ads\nSponsorships\nAffiliate marketing\nPaid guest blogging\nSelling your own products\n6. Become a consultant\nConsulting is one of the oldest professions in the book. But in this digital age, it's taken on a fresh, modern twist.\n\nAt its core, consulting is about providing expert advice", "in a specific field. In today's interconnected world, you don't need to be tied to a big-name firm to make waves. You can be a solo consultant, leveraging your expertise and experience to guide businesses and individuals.\n\nLet's say you've spent a decade in the eCommerce world. You've seen the ins and outs of it. Businesses would pay a premium for that knowledge.\n\nHere's how you can dive in:\n\nIdentify your niche \u2014 eCommerce strategies for small businesses, perhaps?\nOffer tailored solutions, from optimizing online stores to crafting marketing campaigns\nShare your industry expertise through paid workshops or webinars\nWork with industry peers to expand your reach and credibility\nUpfront time investment\nWhile you won't need to create a product from scratch, you'll want to invest time in branding yourself.\n\nThis includes:\n\nRefining your online presence\nCrafting a compelling portfolio\nCreating valuable content that showcases your expertise\nDifficulty level\nTo be a good consultant, you need a deep understanding of your chosen niche. But beyond that, it's about communication, problem-solving, and relationship-building.\n\nThe initial challenge is in building a client base. But once you've got a few success stories under your belt, word of mouth can work wonders.\n\nTo gain traction in the beginning, lean on platforms like LinkedIn. Engage in relevant groups, share your insights, and don't shy away from showcasing your successes.\n\nConsulting business ideas\nHR and talent acquisition strategies\nBranding and visual identity consulting\nCustomer experience and journey mapping\nDigital transformation for traditional businesses\nSustainability and eco-friendly business practices\n7. Seek out sponsorships\nWhen you hear the word \"sponsor,\" you might think of athletes wearing branded gear or celebrities endorsing products. But sponsorships have evolved and are", "no longer just for the famous.\n\nI've personally experienced the power of sponsorships. For instance, in my newsletter, I've partnered with brands that align with my values and resonate with my audience. \n\nIt's been a win-win:\n\nThey get exposure, and I get support to continue delivering exclusive, value-packed content.\n\nReady to tap into this?\n\nIdentify what you offer: Do you have a podcast, a blog, a YouTube channel, or a newsletter with active subscribers?\nUnderstand your audience: What are their interests? What goods or services would they find useful?\nPitch to brands: Craft a compelling proposal showcasing your reach, engagement rates, and audience demographics\nEnsure alignment: Only partner with brands that resonate with your values and your audience's interests\nThe beauty of sponsorships is that they can be super flexible. Whether it's a shoutout in a podcast episode, a dedicated newsletter segment, or a branded video \u2014  the possibilities are endless.\n\nUpfront time investment\nTo attract sponsors, you need a well-documented media kit.\n\nThis includes:\n\nDetails about your audience\nEngagement metrics\nPast sponsorship successes\nPotential collaboration ideas\nIt might take some time to put together, but it'll be your ticket to working with the right partners.\n\nDifficulty level\nThe concept of sponsorships is pretty straightforward as long as you have a platform or channel with a dedicated audience. \n\nRemember, brands want to see engagement, not just numbers. Once you've built that trust and community, sponsorships can be a consistent and ethical revenue stream.\n\nFor me, platforms like LinkedIn and Twitter have been instrumental in connecting with potential sponsors.\n\nSponsorship opportunity ideas\nBlog post collaborations\nPodcast episodes or series\nNewsletters in niche domains\nWebinar or live event partnerships\nSocial media takeovers", "or shoutouts\nMy own portfolio of online one-person businesses\nI\u2019ve covered a range of ideas on how to make money online.\n\nThough haven\u2019t personally pursued all of these revenue streams, I can give you an insight into what my online business looks like.\n\nMy approach has been to build a portfolio of revenue streams.\n\nTreating my career like a Venture Capitalist and knowing that one would hit big.\n\nHere was my revenue breakdown for 2022:\n\nCourses: $1.3M\nCoaching: $144K\nSponsors: $120K\nSubscriptions: $103K\nAffiliates: $25K\nMy business operates on a 94% margin and I\u2019ve spent $0 on ads.\n\nHow?\n\nI\u2019ve built my personal brand and a following of over 800K on social media platforms like LinkedIn and Twitter.\n\nSo, here are my top 16 lessons from the past 3.5+ years of making money online:\n\n16 tips for making money online\nSkip the \"Get Rich Quick\" stuff\nRecognize where you are in the journey\nBe prepared to face adversity\nThink at a macro-level\nIdeation is difficult but there are unique ways\nCreate an audience of prospects with Moneyball\nBuild an ecosystem of creators\nCapture people that are interested\nHave an outcome in mind with your content\nBring people into your world vs. social media\nLearn how to drive traffic\nStart with a service business to learn more about your customers\nSystematize your service growth\nMove to digital products\nTimebox production\nKeep it short, simple, and focused on one outcome\n1. Skip the \"Get Rich Quick\" stuff\nTo start, there are literally zero get-rich-quick schemes.\n\nIf someone is selling you that and you're buying? You're the fool.\n\nCreating income online is a long game. If you want to play, have some patience.\n\n2. Recognize where you are in the journey\nIt's important to recognize that everyone", "has valuable knowledge to share.\n\nDon't compare yourself to the people you idolize who are making money online. Not everyone is as far along on their journey as Gary Vaynerchuk.\n\nThink about the things you've learned on your journey over the last 2-3 years that would be valuable to someone who is behind you on that very same journey.\n\nThat's where the magic is.\n\n3. Be prepared to face adversity\nWhen you start creating content to attract potential customers, know these three things:\n\n1) Nobody will care about you\n\n2) You will get ridiculed at some point\n\n3) Somebody will say something mean to you\n\nIf you can get over those three things, you have thick enough skin to get started.\n\nRemember, everything worth doing is outside of your comfort zone.\n\n\n4. Think at a macro-level\nThere are 7.67B people in this world. You can definitely sell 5, $54 digital products each day and make $100k+ per year, automated.\n\nThe people that win at this game are the people that get started and take action.\n\nNobody is doing this \"perfectly\". Everyone is figuring it out as they go.\n\nWhy not you?\n\n5. Ideation is difficult but there are unique ways\nThere are several ways to think of an idea:\n\n1) Think of a product (terrible way)\n\n2) Solve your own problem (a better way)\n\n3) Create unique content that lets you own a micro-niche with very limited competition. I often refer to this as a \"niche of one\". (best way)\n\n\nA niche of one is a unique combination of skills and interests rolled into one idea and then distributed through highly creative or technical content.\n\nExample:\n\nLet's say you\u2019re", "a financial analyst and your interest is in wine. You could use your financial knowledge to project the value of one high-end wine bottle each morning.\n\n\nIt would be easy to create products and services with that simple idea.\n\nFor example, some people might enjoy a digital course teaching them your method behind wine price projections.\n\nOthers might want a 1:1 Zoom call where you apply your formula to bottles in their collection together, while some would likely just want to purchase a financial analysis of multiple bottles, without the video call.\n\n\nOnce you have your idea, it's important to create an audience of prospects that are likely to pay for your products or services.\n\n6. Create an audience of prospects with Moneyball\nThe best way to create an audience is to choose one social channel and become a master at it.\n\nThe best way to become a master is to start by playing \"Moneyball\".\n\nMoneyball means just getting on base every day i.e. creating content each day and not trying to hit viral home runs.\n\nCompound interest is what matters in content creation.\n\n\n7. Build an ecosystem of creators\nIt's helpful to create an ecosystem of other relevant creators in your space.\n\nWho else is aiming at your niche audience with a slightly different approach?\n\nMake sure you interact with their content on a regular basis. Tether yourself to larger accounts and be active in their comments.\n\nTurn on notifications and get to their content when it happens, adding a tremendous amount of value. Your goal is to be the most relevant comment on a piece of content that", "is seen by prospective customers.\n\nYou can visit my profile here to turn on notifications for my content if relevant to you.\n\n8. Capture people that are interested\nDesign your social media profiles to capture people that are interested in your content.\n\nIf you talk about a niche topic, people should see images and copy on your profile pages that align with that.\n\nFeature your work and website where possible and be very forward with what you write/Tweet/create about.\n\nYour profile pages should be interesting enough to have people want to click the \"follow\" button.\n\nLeverage the featured section (LinkedIn) and pinned Tweet (Twitter) to show off your expertise at a much deeper level.\n\nThere's also a new LinkedIn Profile URL that you can use to show off a website, newsletter, product, or service.\n\n\n9. Have an outcome in mind with your content\nWhen you are creating content, think about it this way:\n\n1) What outcome are you shooting for? Purchases? Dopamine? Email subscribers? Know your end game.\n\n2) Is your content laser-focused on bringing people to your outcome?\n\n3) Are you writing/recording/creating interesting enough content to get people to stop and listen?\n\n4) Are your opinions boring, vanilla, middle-of-the-road, or do you have something interesting to say? Are your opinions strong?\n\nNote: If you're struggling to create content that resonates, build an audience, network with other creators, and find your tribe, I highly recommend my course, The LinkedIn Operating System.\n\nRight now, in 2023, LinkedIn is the easiest place to build a massive audience and business online. Join 14,000+ other students who have rated it 4.98 out of 5 stars.\n\n10. Bring", "people into your world vs. social media\nDo you have a landing page or website where someone can express interest if they want to learn more?\n\nIf not, go to carrd.co and whip up a simple landing page.\n\nMove fast and cheap. Don't worry about getting everything right.\n\nHere's a great landing page example from Starter Story:\n\n\n11. Learn how to drive traffic\nOnce you have v1 of a landing page, then it's time to drive some traffic there.\n\nSince you're already creating content for your primary social channel, why not start to drop that content in other places where people might be spending their time?\n\nPlaces like:\n\nReddit\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nMedium\nHacker News\nIndieHackers\nFacebook groups\nPrivate Slack channels\nEtc.\nEvery channel has its own algorithm and rules.\n\nIf you want to build a predictable, successful, and consistent content strategy, join 6,000+ students in my affordable course, The Content Operating System.\n\n\n12. Start with a service business to learn more about your customers\nIf you can generate enough impressions on your content and start growing a nice following, you can build a small service business.\n\nA service business is usually defined as trading your time for money and providing a service.\n\nThere are 3 levels when building out your service business:\n\n1) Level 1: Low-cost service business with the goal of learning and acquiring testimonials.\n\n2) Level 2: An \"average cost\" service business where your goal is to focus your niche to a very particular client base that you serve best and...\n\n3) Level 3: A high-cost service business where you provide incredible service to a micro-niche and charge top dollar.\n\n13. Systematize your service growth\nThe best process for moving through these", "3 levels is called FITI:\n\nFeedback: get feedback from clients.\nIteration: use that feedback to improve your business.\nTestimonials: get testimonials to improve social proof.\nIncrease: increase your prices the more testimonials you receive.\nOne challenge of running a service business is how many manual tasks are required.\n\nMake sure that you use low-cost, no-code (if you can't code) software tools to make your job easier.\n\nHere are some of my favorites:\n\nWebsite: Kajabi\nScheduling: Calendly\nContent Publishing: HypeFury\nPayments: Stripe & Gumroad\nLinkedIn Analytics: Shield\nWebsite Analytics: Fathom\nCommunity Memberships: Outseta\nCustomer Docs: Notion\nNotifications: Slack\nCustomer CRM: Airtable\nIntegrations: Zapier\n14.

These posts do really well on social media platforms like LinkedIn (and Twitter if they're shorter).\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\n\nCarousels\nPresent a series of slides that tell a story or break down complex ideas. Many brilliant content creators share engaging carousels on LinkedIn and repurpose them on Instagram (if under 10 slides).\n\nEXAMPLE: How to write incredibly persuasive copy with the AIDA model\n\nVideos\nCapture attention with visual storytelling, tutorials, or behind-the-scenes glimpses. Videos are perfect for platforms like TikTok (short-form) and YouTube (long-form).\n\nWhile not my go-to content type, video can be an awesome way to show your personality and build brand loyalty.

If you're starting out and not sure which types your followers will respond best to, I suggest rotating between 5-7 types to discover your sweet spot.\n\n\nExplore 10 types of content to maintain a fresh presence:\n\n1. Listicle\nAttention spans are short these days. Captivate your fans quickly with a good listicle.\n\nListicles break down complex ideas into easily digestible, numbered points. They're fantastic for conveying valuable insights in a concise, organized manner.\n\nI've noticed that listicles grab attention and encourage engagement because they're scannable in seconds.\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\n\n2. Motivational\nPeople on social media want to learn from others who are where they want to be.\n\nMotivate your audience with uplifting content like success stories, inspirational quotes, and personal experiences.

Observation\nObservational", "posts highlight interesting patterns, trends, or phenomena you've noticed in your niche. These posts invite your audience to think critically and engage in meaningful conversations.\n\nUse observational posts as an opportunity to show thought leadership and encourage dialogue. This helps you establish a stronger connection with your audience and positions you as an industry expert.\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\n\n\u200d4. Actionable\nActionable posts give your audience tangible steps, tips, or strategies they can apply to their lives or businesses.\n\nI'm a fan of these because they deliver immediate value, helping followers solve problems and learn something new.\n\nSimilar to observational posts, actionable posts present a stellar opportunity to demonstrate your expertise and generosity. This fosters trust and loyalty among your audience while positioning you as the go-to resource in your niche.\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\n\n5. X vs. Y\nComparison posts present a side-by-side analysis of two concepts, products, or strategies.\n\nThe goal of these is to help your audience understand the differences and make informed decisions. X vs. Y posts simplify complex choices for the reader.\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\n\n6. Contrarian\nContrarian content questions widely accepted beliefs or practices.\n\nOffer a fresh perspective that challenges the status quo. By presenting alternative viewpoints, you inspire people to think outside the box and partake in stimulating debates.\n\nThis is easily one of my favorite content types because it demonstrates intellectual curiosity and helps you stand out from the crowd. My engagement rate is through the roof every time I share a contrarian take.\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\n\n7. Analytical\nAnalytical content explores data, trends, or results, offering your audience in-depth insights and valuable takeaways. These posts demonstrate your ability to dissect complex information or processes and", "make them accessible to your followers.\n\nNow, analytical posts can be boring, so you'll want to present findings in a way that's easily scannable and digestible. A mix of bullet points, numbers, relevant graphics, and/or threads are good for this, depending on where you're publishing.\n\nEXAMPLE: Breaking down how Anthony built a $100K side business in 12 months\n\n\n8. Promotional\nWe live in an attention economy. If you don't promote yourself, no one will.\n\nAs a solopreneur, it's on you to build brand awareness.\n\nThis is where promotional content comes in. It highlights your products, services, or accomplishments, inviting your audience to take action and engage with your brand.\n\nWhile effective in generating leads and sales, too many promotional posts can come off as spammy and overwhelming to your followers. Maintain a balanced, value-driven approach to keep your audience excited about your offerings.\n\nEXAMPLE: Black Friday Sale\n\n9. Social proof\nAn extension to promotional posts, social proof content showcases testimonials, reviews, or case studies from satisfied clients. These posts are powerful because they allow your audience to see the impact of your offerings through the lens of real-life success stories.\n\nSprinkling social proof posts once in a while helps build trust and confidence in your brand, making it easier for potential customers to take the leap and invest in you.\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\n\n10. Partnership (with other creators)\nCollaboration is vital for building a tight-knit community \u2014 and that's what social media is all about.\n\nPartnership content involves teaming up with other creators, influencers, or industry experts.

Make that platform your primary focus.\n\nThis could be Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, TikTok, or LinkedIn, to name a few.\n\nI started on LinkedIn in 2019 and found that people really resonated with my content there. After a few years of building my presence, I branched out to Twitter.\n\n\nIf you want to see the exact system I used to go from 2k to 400k+ followers and $4M+ in", "income with zero paid ads, check out The LinkedIn Operating System.\n\nContent format\nDifferent platforms cater to different content formats.\n\nFor example, Instagram is all about visuals.\n\nTwitter thrives on snappy text updates.\n\nPeople like to go to TikTok for short, entertaining videos.\n\nConsider the type of content you enjoy creating and are good at producing. Then, pick a platform that aligns with your strengths.\n\nBusiness goals\nYour primary platform should also support your business objectives.\n\nIf your goal is to drive website traffic, a platform like Pinterest could be a great fit.\n\nBut if you're looking to build brand awareness, Instagram or TikTok could be the way to go.\n\nCompetitive landscape\nAnalyze your competition and see where they're most active.\n\nIt's important to be present where your competitors are. But also consider platforms where there's less competition and more opportunities to stand out.\n\nThis was actually one of the ways I grew so fast on LinkedIn.\n\nI saw that people weren't doing what I was doing, so I doubled down on it.\n\nThe rest is history.\n\nEase of use and resources\nTime and resources are precious for solopreneurs.\n\nChoose a platform you're comfortable using and make sure it doesn't require a steep learning curve or expensive tools to manage.\n\nThis way, you'll be able to hit the ground running.\n\nStep #3: Set clear, measurable goals\nLet's be real: Without clear, measurable goals, your social media marketing efforts will be like shooting in the dark.\n\nYou might hit the target occasionally, but you'll waste heaps of time and energy along the way.\n\nLet's talk about setting goals that will keep you focused, motivated, and on track to achieve the success", "you deserve.\n\n\nSpecific\nYour goals should be well-defined and leave no room for ambiguity.\n\nInstead of setting a vague goal like \"increase engagement,\" go for something more concrete like \"increase the average number of comments per post by 25% in 3 months.\"\n\nMeasurable\nTo track your progress and know when you've achieved your goals, they must be quantifiable.\n\nMeasure your success with metrics like:\n\nLikes\nShares\nFollowers\nComments\nEmail signups\nWebsite traffic\nLeads generated\nAchievable\nWhile it's great to aim high, setting unrealistic goals can be demoralizing and counterproductive.\n\nMake your goals challenging yet attainable, considering your available resources and the current state of your social media presence.\n\nRelevant\nCraft your social media goals around your business objectives.\n\nIf your primary goal is generating leads, focus on social media goals that support that. This may include growing your email list or driving traffic to your website.\n\nTime-bound\nGive your goals a definitive deadline. Having that sense of urgency keeps you accountable.\n\nDeadlines have helped me prioritize tasks, stay focused, and maintain momentum.\n\nStep #4: Create a content strategy\nYour content strategy is the blueprint for consistent, high-impact content. It keeps you organized and laser-focused on delivering value to your audience.\n\nI suggest developing a content roadmap that outlines the:\n\nTypes of content you'll create\nTopics you'll cover\nPosting frequency\nWhat types of content should I create?\nConsider a mix of promotional, educational, and engaging content to keep your audience interested and coming back for more.\n\n\nThis could include blog posts, videos, images, podcasts, or live streams.\n\nPick the ones that work best on your primary platform.\n\nFor me, that's text-only posts on LinkedIn. But recently, I've been seeing more people create and share videos there as well.\n\nFor more information", "on building a better, faster content production system, check out The Content Operating System and join over 6,000 students.\n\nWhat topics should I cover?\nThe themes to cover in your content should match your target audience's interests and pain points and also your business offerings.\n\nFor example, if you're a fitness coach, your content themes could be:\n\nWorkout tips\nIndustry trends\nNutrition advice\nClient testimonials\nMotivational stories\nPro tip: Aim for a good balance between promotional and non-promotional posts.\n\nWhen in doubt, follow the 80/20 rule.\n\n80% of your content should be educational or entertaining. The remaining 20% can be promotional.\n\nWith this approach, you'll build rapport with your audience and avoid coming across as overly salesy.\n\nHow often should a solopreneur post on social media?\nAs a general rule of thumb, I tell people to go for consistency over quantity.\n\nIt's better to put out high-quality content every time you post than to overwhelm yourself by trying to post daily.\n\nFor example, you might start with a content calendar of 3 posts per week. From there, you can adjust your schedule based on your results and capacity.\n\n\nStep #5: Develop a consistent brand voice\nChances are, you've seen a post online and thought, \"I knew this was written by so-and-so before I even saw their name attached to it.\"\n\nThis is what you should be striving for when writing social media content.\n\nYour brand voice is more than just the words you use.\n\nIt's personality, tone, and style that infuse every piece of content you create.\n\nA consistent brand voice not only helps you stand out from the competition but also fosters a connection with your audience.\n\nTo", "develop your own brand voice, ask yourself these questions:\n\nHow do I want others to perceive me and my brand?\nAm I authoritative and professional, or casual and approachable?\nDo I want to be witty and entertaining, or serious and informative?\nThink about the image you want to project, then choose 3-5 adjectives that best describe your brand personality.\n\nStep #6: Establish a distinct visual identity\nA picture is worth a thousand words. And in the world of social media, a strong visual identity can make all the difference.\n\nYour visual identity is the collection of colors, fonts, images, and design elements that represent your brand and set you apart from the competition.\n\nHere are some things to think about when coming up with your visual style:\n\nSet the stage\nConsider your brand's personality and the emotions you want to evoke with your visuals.\n\nAre you going for a bold, modern look or a warm, vintage vibe?\n\nThink about what your target market would like to see and how your visual style can connect with them more deeply.\n\nChoose your color palette\nColors not only evoke emotions but also help reinforce your brand's personality.\n\nChoose 2-3 primary colors and 1-2 accent colors that work with your brand. Then, use these colors consistently across all your content and marketing materials.\n\nSelect your fonts\nTypography plays a significant role in communicating your brand's message.\n\nChoose 1-2 fonts that complement your brand's personality and are easy to read. Stick to these fonts for all your content, from social media captions to blog posts.\n\nCreate branded templates\nSave time and maintain consistency by making branded templates for your social media", "posts, blog images, and other marketing materials.\n\nThen, use your chosen color palette, fonts, and design elements to make templates that you can easily customize for various content types and topics.\n\nFor example, if you go to the newsletter section of my website, you'll see that all the featured images have a uniform look:\n\n\nThis makes my brand more recognizable and memorable.\n\nStep #7: Engage with your audience\nEngagement is the name of the social media game.\n\nIt's not enough to simply post content and hope for the best.\n\nYou need to actively engage with people to build authentic relationships, foster loyalty, and create a thriving online community.\n\nHere are some ways I make my audience feel valued and heard (and you can too):\n\nRespond to comments and messages\nMake it a priority to respond to comments and messages from your audience in a timely manner.\n\nWhether it's answering a question, addressing a concern, or simply expressing gratitude for their support, your personal touch will go a long way in building trust.\n\nAsk for feedback and opinions\nShow your audience that you value their thoughts by actively seeking their input.\n\nAsk questions in your social media captions, create polls, or host Q&A sessions to encourage engagement.\n\nThis is also a fantastic way to gather valuable insights that can help you improve your content and offerings.\n\nKeep the conversation going\nDon't let the engagement end with a single comment or message.\n\nContinue the conversation by asking follow-up questions, sharing additional resources, or simply showing genuine interest in people's thoughts and experiences.\n\n\nStep #8: Analyze and optimize\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of social media, staying ahead of the", "curve requires constant strategy analysis and optimization.\n\nEvery quarter, I like to reflect and study what worked well (and what didn't). From there, I'll adjust my strategy to get more wins next quarter.\n\nKeep in mind that what works for one person may not work for you. So, don't be afraid to find your groove by testing new ideas and content formats.\n\nBy adopting an analytical and iterative mindset, you'll set yourself up for continuous growth and success on social media.\n\nGet started with social media as a solopreneur\nIn summary, having a strong social media presence is essential for solopreneurs and small businesses.\n\nThe good news is:\n\nThere's no shortage of tactics to build a powerful social media strategy.\n\nYou just need to identify your goals, understand your audience, and stay committed to the process.\n\nWant to grow your online presence and attract a loyal community?\n\nCurate compelling content. Share it consistently across your platforms. Engage with your audience and build real connections.\n\nWant to be a thought leader in your niche?\n\nEstablish your personal brand. Share valuable insights and experiences. Participate in relevant online community discussions and make your voice heard.\n\nMastering social media requires some experimentation. So, don't be afraid to test, learn, and adapt.\n\nNeed more inspiration and guidance?\n\nYou may find my courses, The Operating System and The Content Operating System, helpful.\n\nI hope you found this helpful.\n\nNow get out there and turn your social media presence into a money-making machine.\n\n\u200d", "In the world of entrepreneurship, if you take your foot off the gas, you don't stay neutral.\n\nYou move in reverse.\n\nYou always need to be learning and taking action.\n\nBut the conventional approach to learning has us clinging onto friends, peers, colleagues, bosses, experts, influencers, and anyone else we think might lead us to the promised land.\n\nWe sit, waiting to be spoon-fed the \"secrets\" to success.\n\nBut that doesn't work.\n\nI remember when I started as a solopreneur, feeling completely overwhelmed by the amount of stuff I'd need to know to run a basic business.\n\nEveryone I talked to seemed to have a golden path, but their advice usually left me stuck in the same place, waiting for someone else to unlock the doors of wisdom.\n\nI learned a pretty important lesson in that first year:\n\nIt's critical to take control of our learning and steer ourselves toward success.\n\nIt's the opposite of traditional business culture that conditions us to ask permission, wait our turn, stay in line, and eventually be told what to do. That kind of culture is stagnant and frustrating. And it's the opposite of how you'll need to act as a solopreneur or entrepreneur.\n\nIt's called being \"auto-didactic\": having self-determination and enthusiasm for learning on your own.\n\nAnd it's never been more important.\n\nChoose what to learn, set your own pace, and tailor the learning experience to your specific needs.

But you'll be amazed by how much you can learn independently.\n\nWhen I started writing on LinkedIn in 2018, nobody was using it like they do today.\n\nI thought that was a massive opportunity, so I taught myself how to use LinkedIn like a content creator and turned it into the LinkedIn operating system that 23,000 people use today.\n\nWhen I couldn't figure out how to generate revenue from my content, I experimented for 6 months until I created a complete content operating system that still drives my business revenue today.\n\nThe satisfaction of mastering these skills or overcoming a business challenge on your own is f*cking awesome.\n\nIt builds a sense of confidence, self-reliance, creativity, and determination that no corporate job will ever teach you.\n\nI'm not saying there's no value in the corporate learning structure. There is. But those methods only get you so far. When you're out on your own, conservative learning habits must be squashed.\n\nIn a", "world that's constantly changing, waiting for someone else to teach you means you move in reverse. You get left behind.\n\nSo, are you ready to step out of the shadows of conventional learning and embrace the power of auto-didacticism?\n\nThere's never been a better time to start than today.\n\nFind something you want to learn.

Build an online presence\nHaving a strong online presence is a non-negotiable for solopreneurs today.\n\nYour online presence serves as the foundation of your brand and is often the first point of contact for potential clients.\n\nHere are a few places where you might establish your online presence:\n\nLinkedIn\nI started posting consistently on LinkedIn in 2019, with a focus on solving people's problems.\n\n\nTo date, it's one of my best decisions. I've met so many brilliant people and made awesome friends from all walks of life.\n\nLinkedIn is a powerful tool for networking, showcasing your expertise, and building credibility.\n\nBoost your visibility by optimizing your profile, publishing thought-provoking content, and engaging in relevant discussions.\n\nIf you want to see the exact system I used to go from 2k to 450k+ followers and $4M+ in income with zero paid ads, check out The LinkedIn Operating System.\n\nSocial media\nBesides LinkedIn, you can choose the social media platforms that best align with your target audience and industry.\n\nThis could", "be Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and/or YouTube, to name a few.\n\nI suggest you pick one initially and start growing a loyal following. Once you have an audience there, slowly expand your reach on other platforms.\n\nWherever you go, focus on building a consistent and engaging presence, sharing valuable content, and interacting with your followers.\n\nWebsite\nAfter establishing your footing on social media, create a professional and user-friendly website that showcases your services, portfolio, and testimonials.\n\nMake sure it's easy to navigate, mobile-responsive, and optimized for search engines.\n\nBuilding a beautiful yet functional website doesn't have to be complicated or expensive. If you're on a budget, consider creating a landing page on Carrd first. Then, invest in a more robust site as your business grows.\n\nI currently use Kajabi for my website. I love that it enables me to manage everything in one place, but it's a hefty (and probably unnecessary) investment for newer solopreneurs.\n\n\n2. Network with others in your industry\nBuilding meaningful connections with like-minded professionals in your industry is essential.\n\nNetworking can open doors to new opportunities, collaborations, and valuable insights that can help you grow your business.\n\nHere are a few ways I enjoy networking:\n\nJoin online communities\nEngage in industry-specific forums, social media groups, and discussion boards where you can share your knowledge, exchange ideas, and learn from others in your field.\n\nI belong to a few public communities as well as some private communities with my friends and other solopreneurs.\n\nCollaborate on projects\nSeek out opportunities to work with other professionals in your industry. This doesn't have to mean a paid gig.\n\nJoint ventures and partnerships can help", "you expand your reach, learn new skills, and add value to your offerings.\n\nOne of my favorite ways to collaborate is as a podcast guest. I get to have inspiring conversations with incredible people, share my story, and get my business out there.\n\nBuild relationships\nInstead of just collecting contacts, focus on building genuine relationships with the people you meet.\n\n\nOffer to help and support them when you can, and don't be afraid to ask for advice when you need it.\n\nAfter working for myself for five years, I've learned this:\n\nOne of the best ways to grow is to learn from those smarter than you.\n\n3. Create a memorable visual identity\nA distinctive visual identity helps you stand out from your competition and leaves a lasting impression on your audience.\n\nYour visual identity should reflect your brand's personality and connect with your target customers.\n\nConsider the following elements to craft a memorable visual identity:\n\nLogo\nDesign a unique and eye-catching logo that captures the essence of your brand. It doesn't need to be complex.\n\nMake it versatile enough to work across various platforms and formats, from your website to business cards and social media profiles.\n\nColor palette\nChoose a color scheme that represents your brand's values and appeals to your target audience.\n\nReinforce your brand identity by using the same colors across all of your marketing materials and online presence.\n\nTypography\nSelect fonts that align with your brand and are easily readable. Stick to 2-3 font styles to maintain consistency and avoid visual clutter.\n\nImagery\nUse high-quality images and graphics that complement your brand's message. A consistent visual style creates a cohesive look and feel", "across your marketing assets.\n\n4. Showcase your expertise with compelling content\nPut yourself in the shoes of your buyer.\n\nYou'd only want to buy from someone who demonstrated credibility and know-how in what they do, right?\n\n\nSharing valuable and engaging content is a fantastic way to show what you know and build trust with prospective buyers.\n\nBy consistently publishing insightful content, you'll become an authority in your field and create opportunities for growth.\n\nHere's how I showcase my expertise:\n\nEngage with your audience\nCommunity is huge when it comes to branding.\n\nBuild yours by encouraging feedback, questions, and comments from your audience.\n\nA great way to do this is by closing off a post with either a question or a call to action, to initiate a response from readers.\n\nBesides posting your own content, you should also leave thoughtful comments on other people's posts.\n\nDon't worry; this doesn't have to be as time-consuming as it sounds.\n\nCreate a Notion board with 3 lists of 5 people each:\n\nPeople with a similar following count (they're more likely to engage back on your content)\nLarger creators (more people will see your comments)\nIndustry professionals (let prospects know you exist without sending tacky cold pitches)\nOnce you have your lists, set aside 15 minutes each day to engage with these people.\n\nWith time, your audience will grow and get to know what you're all about.\n\nCreate a content plan\nNeeding to make noise every day gets exhausting for many new business owners.\n\nIn my 5 years of solopreneurship, I've certainly had days where I'm less motivated. But I learned that having a content strategy goes a long way in helping", "me overcome those days.\n\nBasically, a content strategy outlines your goals, target audience, and the types of content you'll create.\n\nThis plan serves as a roadmap for your content creation efforts and ensures consistency in your messaging.\n\nWhen you have this plan in front of you, it becomes much easier to conquer writer's block.\n\n\nA content calendar may look something like this:\n\nMonday: Share industry-related practical tips and insights\nTuesday: Highlight a testimonial or recent case study showing results you brought a client\nWednesday: Promote your business (e.g., your offering, newsletter, podcast feature)\nThursday: Start a conversation about an industry hot-take or opinion\nFriday: A personal story that taught you an important business lesson\nEveryone's content strategy is different.\n\nSo, get creative with yours and do what makes the most sense for your business.\n\nChoose the right formats\nSimilar to content strategy, the best content formats are different for everyone. Don't be afraid to experiment with multiple to see what best resonates with your audience.\n\nI've learned that my audience enjoys short-form text posts on LinkedIn and Twitter. But I also publish informative blog posts and newsletter content on my website at least once a week.\n\nStart by teaching people what you know via various mediums, then narrow it down based on the feedback you receive:\n\nVideos\nPodcasts\nCarousels\nBlog posts\nInfographics\nSocial media updates\nShort-form text posts\nFor more information on building a better, faster content production system, check out The Content Operating System and join over 6,000 students.\n\n5. Tell stories to connect with your audience\nStorytelling is a powerful way to emotionally connect with your audience and make your brand more relatable.\n\nI take my audience on my solopreneurial", "journey by being open about my wins and losses.\n\nBy sharing my progress, experiences, and insights, I build trust with my audience and inspire them to take their first step.\n\nHere's how you might leverage storytelling in your branding and content:\n\nShare your origin story\nYour origin story is the bedrock of your brand. It helps your audience understand what drives and motivates you.\n\nDid you notice a gap in the market and decide to fill it with an innovative product?\n\nHow did you go about doing so?\n\nTalk about it.\n\nYou\u2019ll be surprised at how many people you inspire by telling your story.\n\nHighlight client success stories\nDid you just help your client increase sales by 38% this month?\n\nInvite your audience to celebrate with you!\n\nIllustrate the impact of your work by sharing case studies or testimonials from satisfied clients.\n\nThese stories will not only demonstrate the value of your services but also help prospects envision how you can help them achieve similar results.\n\nBe genuine and vulnerable\n\nDon't be afraid to share your struggles and failures.\n\nWe all go through them in some form at every stage of life.\n\nThere's something extremely humanizing about vulnerability and your audience will connect with you on a more personal level.\n\n6. Deliver value and exceptional customer experiences\nOverdelivering is one of the quickest ways to build a solid reputation and lucrative business.\n\nBy consistently exceeding expectations, your clients will gain confidence in you and your abilities.\n\nThe result of unwavering trust and loyalty?\n\nThose clients will happily refer you to people in their network who need your product or service.\n\nBefore you know it, you've built yourself a mighty", "word-of-mouth machine.\n\nHere are my favorite ways to deliver value and exceptional experiences:\n\nUnderstand your client's needs\nFirst, you need to understand your client's pain points, goals, and expectations.\n\nWho exactly are they looking to work with?\n\nWhat do they want to see happen?\n\nHow can you help them achieve their goals?\n\nGetting clear answers to these questions will help you tailor your solutions to address their specific needs and deliver maximum value.\n\nGo above and beyond\nExceeding your client's expectations doesn't need to take up a lot of your time.\n\nLet's say you get hired to write a blog post based on a provided outline. But as you write it, you notice the client missed an important point worth making.\n\nTake it upon yourself to fill in the gaps, showing you have stellar judgment and work well with little to no handholding.\n\nBe responsive and accessible\nI've worked with a bunch of companies, and many of them share a common struggle:\n\nFinding reliable solopreneurs and freelancers.\n\nOftentimes, projects fall through the cracks because those involved respond too late or completely fail to deliver.\n\nDon't be them.\n\nMake it easy for your clients to reach you by providing multiple communication channels (e.g., Slack and email) and responding quickly to messages. This demonstrates your commitment to their success; they'll know they can always count on you.\n\nNext steps for your solopreneur brand\nBuilding an unforgettable brand from scratch can feel overwhelming at first, especially if you're new to solopreneurship.\n\nNobody is achieving long-term success by flying by the seat of their pants.\n\nThe most successful business owners have effective systems in place.\n\nTo start building your brand, do the", "following:\n\nIdentify your unique selling proposition (USP) and what you'll be known for\nBuild an online presence on a platform like LinkedIn\nOptimize your profile (if you choose LinkedIn)\nShare your expertise through compelling content\nNetwork with industry professionals\nWow your clients with unmatched value and experiences\nContinuously refine your brand based on feedback\nIf you need more guidance on LinkedIn growth, you may enjoy The LinkedIn Operating System, a course I developed which has so far supported 15,000+ students get discovered on the platform.\n\nWant to learn how to create quality content in less time?\n\nCheck out my other course, The Content Operating System. This one focuses on producing high-quality newsletters and social media content.\n\nThat's it for now.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\n", "We live in a world that's obsessed with certificates, diplomas, and structured learning.\n\nThe kind of learning that's neatly packaged into college degrees or training programs.\n\nBut what if the traditional ways that we've approached learning and education, especially in business, are flawed?\n\nA More Unconventional Path\nI remember sitting in training sessions at work, listening to \"experts\" talking about business strategies, marketing tactics, and growth models.\n\nThey were reciting from the same old playbook, but something always felt off to me.\n\nI can vividly remember a board member at my last startup telling me that my salespeople should travel on planes to go prospect - we sold a product that was $6,000. I couldn't help but smirk.\n\nAnd I can clearly recall looking around the room and thinking, \"Am I the only one feeling this way?\"\n\nIt wasn't long after that I started realizing something: real learning doesn't always come in neat packages.\n\nWe learn the most when we start doing things, not hearing or reading things. Even when the teacher has \"been there, done that\", the advice given doesn't always work. Why?\n\nBecause conventional wisdom isn't always wise.\n\nThe Skeptic's Guide to Learning\nSo, what does learning look like when we throw conventional wisdom out the window?\n\nHere's what I've come up with:\n\nQuestion Everything: Don't accept something just because \"that's how it's always been done\". Dig deeper, challenge assumptions, and don't be afraid to ask \"Why?\" Often, the stuff being taught is 5, 10, or even 20 years old.\nUse Trial and Error: Failure can be one hell of a teacher. I've made tons of mistakes, and I've", "or reading things. Even when the teacher has \"been there, done that\", the advice given doesn't always work.

I've made tons of mistakes, and I've learned more from them than from any classroom lesson. Your journey will look different than other people's. So make your own mistakes and learn your own lessons.\nFind Your Own Path: Find mentors, read books, take online courses, and experiment. But you can't just seek out knowledge - you must put it into action. Create your unique learning journey by testing, analyzing, iterating, and repeating.\nIntegrate Learning into Life: Outside of mentors, books, and online courses, make sure that you integrate learning into your daily work. Don't think of learning and working as separate. They are the same! So make sure you're setting up systems to capture what you learn as you put in the work.\nChanging the Culture\nThis approach isn't easy.\n\nIt's often met with skepticism, or \"trust me, the old way works.\"\n\nBut it's worth asking - are you satisfied with the status quo around learning and development? Are you content with simply going through the motions of another", "workshop or training program?\n\nThere's a better way. A way that incorporates individuality, curiosity, and the entrepreneurial spirit that drives each of us.\n\nIt's about owning your learning, taking control, and not being dedicated to the best practices of the business world.\n\nInstead, maybe it's time you created your own best practices?\n\nIn Summary\nThe conventional learning path may be comfortable, but I don't find it useful. I didn't learn how to build a business by reading about it or listening to stories.\n\nInstead, I found that stepping out of my comfort zone and embracing a different approach to learning worked really well for me: Doing stuff and watching what happened.\n\nSo, maybe it's time you started asking some questions, challenging the status quo, taking action, and learning on your own terms.\n\nThe best investment we can make is in ourselves, in our own way.\n\nAnd you know what? Your specific journey will always be one worth taking.", "The #1 reason why solopreneurs never get traction with their online business is they aren\u2019t focused on a specific customer.\n\nInstead, they are wildly unfocused.\n\nI want to teach you 3 different methods to \u201cfind your niche\u201d and target a specific audience with a specific problem.\n\nA problem you can solve.\n\n\n3 ways to choose your niche\nChoosing a sub-niche by audience\nChoosing a sub-niche by product or service\nCreating your own \"niche of one\"\nMethod 1: Choosing a sub-niche by audience\nA sub-niche is a smaller subsection of a broad audience. Generally, it works like this:\n\nBroad audience \u2192 niche \u2192 sub-niche\n\nYou can apply this formula to the audience you\u2019re looking to attract.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s say you're a personal trainer looking to build an online coaching business.\n\nRather than targeting athletes (broad audience), or runners (niche), you could focus specifically on marathon runners (sub-niche).\n\nThis example assumes you have deep knowledge of marathon running and can speak intelligently about the topic.\n\nMethod 2: Choosing a sub-niche by product or service\nYou can also apply this to the product or service that you are creating to arrive at your audience.\n\nInstead of your product being a book (broad product), or a cookbook (niche), you could focus specifically on creating a vegan dessert cookbook (sub-niche).\n\nOr, rather than offering a generic service such as coaching (broad service), or leadership coaching (niche), you could focus specifically on leadership coaching for female entrepreneurs (sub-niche).\n\nThe result?\n\nOnce you narrow down to a sub-niche, your audience is more likely to have the same challenges, and therefore the same wants and needs.\n\nThat\u2019s where you come in.\n\nNow what?\n\nOnce you\u2019ve narrowed", "or service\nYou can also apply this to the product or service that you are creating to arrive at your audience.\n\nInstead of your product being a book (broad product), or a cookbook (niche), you could focus specifically on creating a vegan dessert cookbook (sub-niche).\n\nOr, rather than offering a generic service such as coaching (broad service), or leadership coaching (niche), you could focus specifically on leadership coaching for female entrepreneurs (sub-niche).\n\nThe result?\n\nOnce you narrow down to a sub-niche, your audience is more likely to have the same challenges, and therefore the same wants and needs.\n\nThat\u2019s where you come in.\n\nNow what?\n\nOnce you\u2019ve narrowed it down to your sub-niche audience, you can start learning more about them.\n\nWhere do they hang out online?\nWhat jargon and language do they use?\nWhat podcasts and YouTube channels do they watch?\nWho is already serving this audience i.e. who are your competitors?\nMethod 3: Creating your own \"niche of one\"\nThe most compelling creators online are, what I call, a niche of one.\n\nA niche of one is a unique combination of skills and interests rolled into one idea and then distributed through highly creative or technical content.\n\nWhen you do this well, you own a micro-niche.\n\nYou become the category creator. The best in show. The only.\n\nAnd you can deliver products and services that people will pay for.\n\nIf you want to do this well, you need to understand the formula and the 6 building blocks behind a niche of one.\n\n\nI\u2019ll break them down and then put them back together in the hopes that it helps you become a more compelling creator.\n\nHow", "to create your \u201cNiche of One\u201d\nPick something you excel at\nChoose something you're interested in\nCombine them\nCreate a distribution system\nAllow an audience to form\nAsk them what they need\n1. Skills: Something you excel at\nMost skills, by themselves, are not unique.\n\nLots of people can write, speak English and Portuguese, or do financial analysis.\n\nToo often, people make the mistake of choosing a skill when deciding to create online. I\u2019m a writer, so I\u2019ll write. I\u2019m a painter, so I\u2019ll paint. I know how to do X, so I\u2019ll teach people how to do X. You get the point.\n\nThe difficulty arises when the inevitable question comes up:\n\n\u201cWhat do I write about today?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do I paint today?\"\n\u201cWhat do I teach today?\u201d\n\n\nWhen the brain faces a creative block, people either quit creating or create something subpar. Two poor outcomes.\n\nLet\u2019s introduce interests into the equation and see what happens.\n\n2. Interests: What you're passionate about\nThis guide is not meant to be cliche. \u201cChase your dreams!\u201d. \u201cDo something you love and you\u2019ll never work a day in your life!\u201d That's all nonsense.\n\nBut, interests are important. They keep us...well\u2026interested.\n\nMaybe you're fluent in English and Portuguese and you\u2019re extremely well-versed in marketing. Maybe you understand financial analysis and your hobby is high-end wine.\n\nWhen you read those sentences, nothing unique or compelling really jumps out. So, now what?\n\nLet\u2019s put them together to start formulating an interesting idea.\n\n3. Idea: Combine the above two\nThe idea block of a niche of one is where most people get it wrong. They let a lack of creativity keep them from building something unique.\n\nFor example, we\u2019ve", "all had ideas before, but they end up as unfinished blog posts, abandoned podcasts, or dwindling YouTube channels.\n\nThat\u2019s because the creation must be forced. You\u2019re starting from a blank canvas every morning. We\u2019re back to the same old questions:\n\n\u201cWhat do I write about today?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do I paint today?\"\n\u201cWhat do I teach today?\u201d\n\nIn a niche of one, you create one idea, and then learn how to say it, do it, or package it 1,000+ different ways.\n\nLet\u2019s use our examples from above.\n\nExample #1: You\u2019re a financial analyst and your interest is in wine.\n\nUnique idea: Use your financial knowledge to project the value of one high-end wine bottle each morning.\n\n\nExample #2: You're fluent in English and Portuguese and your interest is in marketing.\n\nUnique idea: Translate one of your favorite company landing pages from English to Portuguese using local dialect and slang, every day.\n\n\nYou could easily argue that these ideas are not interesting, but you\u2019d be missing the larger point. They are one single idea that can be produced and reproduced 1000x over.\n\nThe game of \u201cwhat do I do today?\u201d is now over.\n\nThese ideas, when shared broadly through proper distribution, attract a natural audience of interested people.\n\n4/5. Distribution & Audience: Create a distribution system\nIn order for people to discover your unique and interesting idea, they have to be able to find it. This is where distribution comes into play.\n\nYour audience is an outcome of good distribution.\n\nHaving a niche of one gives you an advantage because you\u2019ve increased the number of places you can distribute.\n\nFor example, if you\u2019re our financial whiz/wine", "lover, you can distribute on sites centered around wine, the wine exchange, finance trends, etc.\n\nI\u2019d recommend focusing on the following:\n\nPersonal blog or newsletter: a place where your content can live forever and can be a catch-all for email subscribers.\nSocial media: pick one channel and master it. Don\u2019t try to be a social media hero from the start.\nIndustry sites: every skill and interest has industry sites. For example, I like to talk about building online, so I can find great channels on IndieHackers.\nSlack Channels: join private Slack communities centered around your skills or interests.\nBy distributing routinely, a natural audience will grow.\n\nRemember, you don\u2019t pick your audience, they pick you. You simply set up a system where more people are likely to find you.\n\n\nIf you\u2019re our finance/wine person from above, you will naturally attract an audience of people who love wine, sommeliers, and collectors.\n\nBut, you\u2019re also likely to attract people who have an interest in data analysis, financial trends, the market, exchanges, and so on.\n\n6. Product: Ask your audience what they need\nNow comes the easiest part. Asking and listening.\n\nWith an audience built around a specific, unique idea, you can simply start to ask them what would be most helpful, and listen to their answers.\n\nIt\u2019s amazing how many people skip this critical step.\n\nAsk on social or send out a survey via email. What would they like to learn? What would they be happy to spend some money on?\n\nFor example, some people might enjoy a digital course teaching them your method behind wine price projections.\n\nOthers might want a 1:1 Zoom", "call where you apply your formula to bottles in their collection together, while some would likely just want to purchase a financial analysis of multiple bottles, without the video call.\n\nAll of this can be placed on a value ladder that people can move up over time:\n\n\nSummary\nIn summary, the internet is getting crowded.\n\nPicking your passion and then trying to write or record from scratch each day can be a very daunting task.\n\nThe most compelling creators you see online have a system. Nobody is out here winging it.\n\nSo, to get started, do the following:\n\nPick something you excel at\nChoose something you're interested in\nCombine them\nCreate a distribution system\nAllow an audience to form\nAsk them what they need\nThat's all for my guide on choosing a profitable niche.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\n", "For many years, I was nothing more than a spectator in the world of entrepreneurship.\n\nWhile I watched my friends build their brands and transform them into successful businesses, I remained on the sidelines, paralyzed by the fear of the unknown.\n\nUp until 2018, I had never put pen to paper or fingers to keyboard to share my thoughts online.\n\nWhy?\n\nThe answer was simple, but also very complex: fear.\n\nI was terrified of putting myself out there.

What's the tactical plan for moving from dreamer to doer?\n\nHere are two steps that helped me.\n\nTwo Action Steps to Get Started Today\n1. Map Your Fear Landscape\nWrite down your specific fears and anxieties about putting yourself out there. Next to each, write down a rational response or a way to overcome that fear.\n\nSometimes, simply acknowledging these fears can diminish their power over you.\n\nFor example: \"I'm afraid that someone will say something nasty to me\" is reframed to: \"For every person who says something nasty, it's likely that 99 will say something kind.\"\n\n2. Set a 30-Day Challenge with Public Accountability\nCommit to a small daily action related to your goal for the next 30 days. Share this commitment with a friend, family member, or in public on social media.\n\nPublic accountability will motivate you and keep you on track.\n\nFor example: Erwan Lier decided to finally put himself out there when he read a Tweet of mine about growing on Twitter. It's changed his whole life in 60 days.\n\n\nThe Path Forward\nThe path of the solopreneur is filled with unique challenges and occasional setbacks.\n\nBut it also offers the potential for something truly remarkable.", "A chance to build something of your own, express your ideas and creativity, and make a meaningful impact on others.\n\nWhy not you? Why not today?\n\nYou have the power to change your life. And you don't need to wait for a perfect moment or a sign from the universe. The right time is now, and the person to do it is you.\n\nSo, stop reading about starting. Stop dreaming about starting. Stop planning to get started. Just start. Your future self will thank you.\n\nIf you're interested in starting on LinkedIn, come join 15,000 students and 30 LinkedIn Top Voices who got started using my LinkedIn Operating System to grow and monetize their LinkedIn.\n\nPrefer a starting with a newsletter & Twitter?
