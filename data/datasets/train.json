["Ever wonder why companies want you to come back to the office?    Or spend all day at your desk?    Me too.    Sure...I understand the camaraderie.    Or teamwork.    And some things are more easily done in person than virtually. I get that.    But here's something else I think:    Success is not about long hours in the office. Or sitting at your desk from 9 to 5.    It's about good ideas and sharp execution.    And sometimes, the best ideas come when you're away from your desk.    Like at the dinner table, on a run, or playing with your kids.    Spending time with family isn't just nice, it helps us think better.    Don't get stuck on the old idea that more hours at work means more success.    Try something different.    Spend more time living life, and you might find you're better at your job.    Maybe a new way to measure success is in the quality of our ideas, and how we execute them - not the quantity of our hours.    Your desk isn't going anywhere, but your life is.    Build life-work balance.    Not the other way around.   9 Entrepreneurial Lessons from the Netflix documentary, 'Sly' about Sylvester Stallone.  1. Pursue your passion", "work means more success.

Maybe a new way to measure success is in the quality of our ideas, and how we execute them - not the quantity of our hours.    Your desk isn't going anywhere, but your life is.    Build life-work balance.    Not the other way around.   9 Entrepreneurial Lessons from the Netflix documentary, 'Sly' about Sylvester Stallone.  1. Pursue your passion relentlessly:  \"I am not the richest, smartest, or most talented person in the world, but I succeed because I keep going and going and going.\"  2. Have a mindset of unbridled optimism:  \"I believe any success in life is made by going into an area with a blind, furious optimism.\"  3. Use rejection as a motivator:  \"I take rejection as someone blowing a bugle in my ear to wake me up and get going, rather than a signal to retreat.\"  4. Adaptability in the Face of Challenge:  \"Every time I've failed, people had me out for the count, but I always come back.\"  5. Build a network of loyal people who love you:  \"I learned the real meaning of love. Love is absolute loyalty. People fade, looks fade, but loyalty never fades.\"  6. Develop a high level of persistence:  \"It ain't about how hard you", "hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward.\"  7. Be a continuous learner:  \"Remember the mind is your best muscle... Big arms can move rocks, but big words can move mountains.\"  8. Don't let failure dictate your mind:  \"Success is usually the culmination of controlling failure.\"  9. Never stop trying to get better:  \"I'm always looking for a new challenge. There are a lot of mountains to climb out there. When I run out of mountains, I'll build a new one.\"  Here are 51,000 people you won't need to compete with.

Think about every wildly successful person you know in nearly any industry.    There's a good chance that they are both:    1. Excellent at what they do.  2. Have been doing it for a long time.    So, why are so many people trying to circumvent this equation with short-term hacks and tricks?    They won't win.  It rarely works.    If you want to be great at something, here's what you should focus on:    1. Invest in your expertise:    This means constantly learning, growing, and challenging yourself.    The world is evolving rapidly, and those who don't keep up will quickly fall behind. If you're being cheap in your self-investment, you're", "making a big mistake.    2. Give it time:    Success is not an overnight phenomenon no matter how many people try to sell you this nonsense.    It's the result of consistent effort over time.    Go on a journey you enjoy and understand that every step, even the setbacks, is a big part of your growth.    Patience isn't just a virtue; it's a necessity.    The secret to success lies in perseverance and continuous improvement.    So, ask yourself: Are you investing in your expertise?    Are you giving your journey the time it deserves?    If not, change it up this weekend.   Becoming an entrepreneur is not about quitting your job.    It's about reinventing your whole life.    We often hear about the desire to quit and chase dreams of entrepreneurship and freedom.    But it's not easy. Or for everyone.    It's difficult to create a life where work aligns with passion, purpose, and personal growth.    If you're trying to make this transition successfully, consider these moves:    1. Identify Your Core Strengths:    Understand (specifically) what you're exceptionally good at and enjoy doing. Both of these are required for entrepreneurial longevity.    2. Develop a Financial Cushion:    Before taking the leap, build a financial safety net. Try to save", "6-12 months of spending cash and build your side project to 60% of your total earnings.    3. Adapt Continuously:    The world of entrepreneurship is ever-evolving. Stay ahead by constantly learning new skills and keep experimenting with new content, products, networking ideas, etc.    4. Build a Huge Support Network:    Surround yourself with mentors, peers, and a community that supports you. That actually wants you to win. Their guidance, encouragement, and shared experiences are invaluable.    If you've made this transition, or are considering it, what else have you found to be most effective? ", "I've made over $4M in the last 4 years online, including over $2M on digital course sales in the last 2 years.  I put together this free guide to share a lot of what I've learned. I'll be updating it continuously as I learn and remember more.  This guide breaks down different ways to make money online and captures learnings from my actual work, wins, and losses.  If you want updates, simply subscribe to my newsletter.  Part 1: 7 ways to make money online Part 2: My own portfolio of online one-person businesses Part 3: 16 tips for making money online from what I\u2019ve learned I hope you find this helpful.  Don't overcomplicate making money online Most people want to make money online, but they make the process harder than it needs to be.  This can prevent them from getting started at all.  After building a portfolio of one-person businesses to over $4M in revenue, I\u2019ve learned that making money online doesn't have to be complex.   With this in mind, let's dive into 7 possible income streams to make your first dollar on the internet.  7 ways to make money online Offer your skill as a service Create and sell digital products Offer Software as a Service (SaaS) Do cohort-based coaching Monetize a personal blog Become a consultant Seek out sponsorships 1. Offer your skill as a service One of the best ways to make money online is by selling your skill as a service. ", "businesses to over $4M in revenue, I\u2019ve learned that making money online doesn't have to be complex.

Offer your skill as a service One of the best ways to make money online is by selling your skill as a service.  I like this method because upfront costs are low, but the earning potential is significant.  Let's say you're new to solopreneurship and don't have the capital to start a traditional business, but your friends, family, and past employers have mentioned you're an excellent writer.  You can monetize that skill by selling writing services:  Write ad copy for businesses Ghostwrite blogs for CEOs and founders Produce written social media content for brands The list goes on.  Depending on what skill you're selling, you likely don't need much to get started. For example, freelance writers can manage with a reliable laptop and an internet connection.  Upfront time investment Be ready to invest a full day into optimizing your LinkedIn & Twitter profiles to attract ideal clients.  Then set up a service page showcasing your offering.   Difficulty level The work itself can be easy if you're great at what you do.", "But getting clients can be tough in the beginning.  Having an established presence and credibility helps you land gigs easier and quicker. If you have the skill but no audience, you'll need to build a social media following on one platform in the beginning.  I recommend LinkedIn or Twitter for creative services like writing. But some service offerings may attract clients on different platforms (e.g. photography or visual design on Instagram).  Don't be afraid to experiment on a few channels to see which one gets you the most traction. Once you figure that out, I'd focus on building there before branching out.  Business ideas for service providers Marketing consultant Freelance writing Virtual Assistant Graphic design Photography Online tutor Web design Data entry 2. Create and sell digital products Many freelancers I know eventually create digital products once they've monetized their skills over time.  This revenue stream works well if you build a personal brand while freelancing. When you share your learnings publicly online, people resonate, gain trust, and want to buy from you.  In my early days of solopreneurship, I offered consulting services to clients in the SaaS industry. While doing this, I committed to a daily writing habit and consistently showed up on LinkedIn.  What came out of it was incredible:  People enjoyed the content I shared People trusted me as I built authority People were intrigued by my journey People asked me questions about creating content and building a personal brand From there, I saw an", "opportunity to create affordable digital products.  So I packaged up everything I learned from the past 4 years of solopreneurship into 2 courses: The Operating System and The Content Operating System.   The Operating System is for people wanting to grow their LinkedIn presence and eventually monetize it.  In this course, I go over tips on how to:  Write compelling social media posts Develop meaningful relationships Get inbound and outbound leads The Content Operating System is for those wanting to create and scale content.  The lessons focus on the systems I use to produce quality content quickly \u2014 not just social media posts but also blog articles, guides, newsletters, you name it.  Upfront time investment The time investment comes down to what kind of digital product you're offering. A course may take a full month or more to make, while checklists and templates can be done in a day.  Difficulty level Creating one-off digital products is generally less time-consuming than full courses. I recommend starting here if you're thinking about making money online this way.  You could create templates, checklists, and guides that sell for $10-50 on your website.   The beauty of selling digital products is that once they're made, you can sell them indefinitely and make passive income.  But there's a catch:  You need a loyal audience with pain points (that you can address).  If you don't have a social media following, I suggest building that before creating any digital products. The", "last thing you want to do is put in all the work but have no one to sell to.  Once you have the audience, it becomes much easier.  When creating my courses, I kept things simple. The content and lessons are what people pay for, not fancy videos with an even fancier background.  Remember, it's possible to produce amazing value without spending a fortune on shiny objects like an expensive microphone or editing software.  Don't overthink it \u2014 just do it!  Digital product ideas Templates Checklists Courses eBooks Guides 3. Offer Software as a Service (SaaS) What I love most about SaaS is its recurring revenue model. Instead of a one-time sale, you're building relationships with your customers, and providing them with continuous value. In return, you get consistent income.  Imagine you notice a gap in the market. Maybe small businesses that struggle with scheduling appointments, and you think, \"Hey! I can create a simple tool to solve that.\" There's your SaaS idea.  Here's how you can monetize this:  Create a subscription-based tool for appointment scheduling Offer a basic version for free and premium features at a cost Set up integrations with other popular tools to enhance functionality Upfront time investment Building a great SaaS product requires a significant time investment upfront. You'll need to conceptualize the software, develop it (or hire developers), and then test it rigorously.  But remember, once it's live and you've got users, the feedback loop can help you refine and improve without", "needing to start from scratch.  Difficulty level I won't sugarcoat it. This isn't the easiest online business venture. Developing a SaaS product requires technical know-how or the capital to hire those who do.  But the payoff? It can be massive.  Building an audience for your SaaS product is crucial. Platforms like Product Hunt or even LinkedIn can be goldmines for initial traction. And don't forget about content marketing \u2014 offering valuable insights related to your product niche can draw in potential users.  Business ideas for SaaS entrepreneurs Virtual event platforms E-commerce optimization tools CRM systems for niche markets Social media analytics platforms Online booking systems for niche services Task automation tools for specific industries 4. Do cohort-based coaching One of the emerging trends in the online education space is cohort-based coaching.  It combines the best of both worlds: the personal touch of live coaching and the scalability of online courses.  You're essentially guiding a group of people through a learning journey together, fostering community and accountability.  Got a knack for digital marketing? Instead of coaching people one-on-one, gather a group and take them through a structured, time-bound program.  Here's how you can leverage this:  Design a 6-week program on digital marketing strategies Incorporate live sessions, Q&A's, and group activities Use platforms like Zoom or Discord for live interactions Offer additional resources, templates, and tools to enhance the learning experience Upfront time investment Crafting a cohort-based course requires a blend of curriculum design, content creation, and community management.", "This could take weeks or months, depending on how extensive you want it to be. But once it's ready, you can run the program multiple times, making minor tweaks as required.  Difficulty level While it's less tech-intensive than creating a SaaS, cohort-based coaching demands strong interpersonal skills and industry expertise.  One of the main challenges is ensuring every cohort feels as engaged and valued as the last. But with the right energy and commitment, the rewards \u2014 both in terms of impact and monetary gain \u2014 can be substantial.  Before you launch your cohort-based course, focus on building a loyal audience. Platforms like LinkedIn, Twitter, or even niche-specific forums can be your best friend here. Share valuable insights, engage in discussions, and position yourself as an authority in your domain.  Cohort-based coaching business ideas Creative writing workshops Digital marketing boot camps Entrepreneurship and startup masterclasses Health and wellness transformation programs Personal development and life coaching sessions Niche-specific skill training (e.g. podcasting, video editing, photography) 5. Monetize a personal blog Many social media influencers also have personal blogs where they make extra money through advertisements, sponsorships, and affiliate marketing.  First, you can display ads on your blog and earn money when people view or click on them.  Sponsored content is another popular way of monetizing a personal blog.  Here's how it works:  Brands pay you a fixed amount to write a blog to promote their products or services. Often, they'll also provide a unique promotion code for you to", "include in the blog post. If someone makes a purchase with your code, you get a commission.  Besides paid ads, sponsorships, and affiliate marketing, you can sell your own products. This could be online courses or print-on-demand goods, depending on what your audience will find valuable.  Upfront time investment Designing and launching a WordPress blog from scratch may take a day or a month, depending on your experience.  But after setting it up, remember that search engine optimization for new websites can take time to bear fruit.  Before thinking about monetizing, you'll need to:  Create high-quality content to rank well on search engines Gather social proof to attract worthwhile partnerships Build an audience somewhere to funnel people over to your blog Difficulty level If you enjoy writing online, then running a personal blog may be your next passion project.  But that doesn't mean it'll be easy. Blogging involves more than just creating content.  If you're only good at writing, you may need help in other areas:  Troubleshooting Optimizing site speed Ensuring mobile-friendliness Website design and graphics Blogging business ideas Paid ads Sponsorships Affiliate marketing Paid guest blogging Selling your own products 6. Become a consultant Consulting is one of the oldest professions in the book. But in this digital age, it's taken on a fresh, modern twist.  At its core, consulting is about providing expert advice in a specific field. In today's interconnected world, you don't need to be tied to a big-name firm to make waves.", "You can be a solo consultant, leveraging your expertise and experience to guide businesses and individuals.  Let's say you've spent a decade in the eCommerce world. You've seen the ins and outs of it. Businesses would pay a premium for that knowledge.  Here's how you can dive in:  Identify your niche \u2014 eCommerce strategies for small businesses, perhaps? Offer tailored solutions, from optimizing online stores to crafting marketing campaigns Share your industry expertise through paid workshops or webinars Work with industry peers to expand your reach and credibility Upfront time investment While you won't need to create a product from scratch, you'll want to invest time in branding yourself.  This includes:  Refining your online presence Crafting a compelling portfolio Creating valuable content that showcases your expertise Difficulty level To be a good consultant, you need a deep understanding of your chosen niche. But beyond that, it's about communication, problem-solving, and relationship-building.  The initial challenge is in building a client base. But once you've got a few success stories under your belt, word of mouth can work wonders.  To gain traction in the beginning, lean on platforms like LinkedIn. Engage in relevant groups, share your insights, and don't shy away from showcasing your successes.  Consulting business ideas HR and talent acquisition strategies Branding and visual identity consulting Customer experience and journey mapping Digital transformation for traditional businesses Sustainability and eco-friendly business practices 7. Seek out sponsorships When you hear the word \"sponsor,\" you might think of athletes wearing branded", "gear or celebrities endorsing products. But sponsorships have evolved and are no longer just for the famous.  I've personally experienced the power of sponsorships. For instance, in my newsletter, I've partnered with brands that align with my values and resonate with my audience.   It's been a win-win:  They get exposure, and I get support to continue delivering exclusive, value-packed content.  Ready to tap into this?  Identify what you offer: Do you have a podcast, a blog, a YouTube channel, or a newsletter with active subscribers? Understand your audience: What are their interests? What goods or services would they find useful? Pitch to brands: Craft a compelling proposal showcasing your reach, engagement rates, and audience demographics Ensure alignment: Only partner with brands that resonate with your values and your audience's interests The beauty of sponsorships is that they can be super flexible. Whether it's a shoutout in a podcast episode, a dedicated newsletter segment, or a branded video \u2014  the possibilities are endless.  Upfront time investment To attract sponsors, you need a well-documented media kit.  This includes:  Details about your audience Engagement metrics Past sponsorship successes Potential collaboration ideas It might take some time to put together, but it'll be your ticket to working with the right partners.  Difficulty level The concept of sponsorships is pretty straightforward as long as you have a platform or channel with a dedicated audience.   Remember, brands want to see engagement, not just numbers. Once you've built that trust", "and community, sponsorships can be a consistent and ethical revenue stream.  For me, platforms like LinkedIn and Twitter have been instrumental in connecting with potential sponsors.  Sponsorship opportunity ideas Blog post collaborations Podcast episodes or series Newsletters in niche domains Webinar or live event partnerships Social media takeovers or shoutouts My own portfolio of online one-person businesses I\u2019ve covered a range of ideas on how to make money online.  Though haven\u2019t personally pursued all of these revenue streams, I can give you an insight into what my online business looks like.  My approach has been to build a portfolio of revenue streams.  Treating my career like a Venture Capitalist and knowing that one would hit big.  Here was my revenue breakdown for 2022:  Courses: $1.3M Coaching: $144K Sponsors: $120K Subscriptions: $103K Affiliates: $25K My business operates on a 94% margin and I\u2019ve spent $0 on ads.  How?  I\u2019ve built my personal brand and a following of over 800K on social media platforms like LinkedIn and Twitter.  So, here are my top 16 lessons from the past 3.5+ years of making money online:  16 tips for making money online Skip the \"Get Rich Quick\" stuff Recognize where you are in the journey Be prepared to face adversity Think at a macro-level Ideation is difficult but there are unique ways Create an audience of prospects with Moneyball Build an ecosystem of creators Capture people that are interested Have an outcome in mind with your content Bring people", "into your world vs. social media Learn how to drive traffic Start with a service business to learn more about your customers Systematize your service growth Move to digital products Timebox production Keep it short, simple, and focused on one outcome 1. Skip the \"Get Rich Quick\" stuff To start, there are literally zero get-rich-quick schemes.  If someone is selling you that and you're buying? You're the fool.  Creating income online is a long game. If you want to play, have some patience.  2. Recognize where you are in the journey It's important to recognize that everyone has valuable knowledge to share.  Don't compare yourself to the people you idolize who are making money online. Not everyone is as far along on their journey as Gary Vaynerchuk.  Think about the things you've learned on your journey over the last 2-3 years that would be valuable to someone who is behind you on that very same journey.  That's where the magic is.  3. Be prepared to face adversity When you start creating content to attract potential customers, know these three things:  1) Nobody will care about you  2) You will get ridiculed at some point  3) Somebody will say something mean to you  If you can get over those three things, you have thick enough skin to get started.  Remember, everything worth doing is outside of your comfort zone.   4. Think at a macro-level There are 7.67B people in this world. You can", "definitely sell 5, $54 digital products each day and make $100k+ per year, automated.  The people that win at this game are the people that get started and take action.  Nobody is doing this \"perfectly\". Everyone is figuring it out as they go.  Why not you?  5. Ideation is difficult but there are unique ways There are several ways to think of an idea:  1) Think of a product (terrible way)  2) Solve your own problem (a better way)  3) Create unique content that lets you own a micro-niche with very limited competition. I often refer to this as a \"niche of one\". (best way)   A niche of one is a unique combination of skills and interests rolled into one idea and then distributed through highly creative or technical content.  Example:  Let's say you\u2019re a financial analyst and your interest is in wine. You could use your financial knowledge to project the value of one high-end wine bottle each morning.   It would be easy to create products and services with that simple idea.  For example, some people might enjoy a digital course teaching them your method behind wine price projections.  Others might want a 1:1 Zoom call where you apply your formula to bottles in their collection together, while some would likely just want to purchase a financial analysis of multiple bottles, without the video call.   Once you have your idea, it's important to create an audience of prospects", "that are likely to pay for your products or services.  6. Create an audience of prospects with Moneyball The best way to create an audience is to choose one social channel and become a master at it.  The best way to become a master is to start by playing \"Moneyball\".  Moneyball means just getting on base every day i.e. creating content each day and not trying to hit viral home runs.  Compound interest is what matters in content creation.   7. Build an ecosystem of creators It's helpful to create an ecosystem of other relevant creators in your space.  Who else is aiming at your niche audience with a slightly different approach?  Make sure you interact with their content on a regular basis. Tether yourself to larger accounts and be active in their comments.  Turn on notifications and get to their content when it happens, adding a tremendous amount of value. Your goal is to be the most relevant comment on a piece of content that is seen by prospective customers.  You can visit my profile here to turn on notifications for my content if relevant to you.  8. Capture people that are interested Design your social media profiles to capture people that are interested in your content.  If you talk about a niche topic, people should see images and copy on your profile pages that align with that.  Feature your work and website where possible and be very forward with what you write/Tweet/create", "about.  Your profile pages should be interesting enough to have people want to click the \"follow\" button.  Leverage the featured section (LinkedIn) and pinned Tweet (Twitter) to show off your expertise at a much deeper level.  There's also a new LinkedIn Profile URL that you can use to show off a website, newsletter, product, or service.   9. Have an outcome in mind with your content When you are creating content, think about it this way:  1) What outcome are you shooting for? Purchases? Dopamine? Email subscribers? Know your end game.  2) Is your content laser-focused on bringing people to your outcome?  3) Are you writing/recording/creating interesting enough content to get people to stop and listen?  4) Are your opinions boring, vanilla, middle-of-the-road, or do you have something interesting to say? Are your opinions strong?  Note: If you're struggling to create content that resonates, build an audience, network with other creators, and find your tribe, I highly recommend my course, The LinkedIn Operating System.  Right now, in 2023, LinkedIn is the easiest place to build a massive audience and business online. Join 14,000+ other students who have rated it 4.98 out of 5 stars.  10. Bring people into your world vs. social media Do you have a landing page or website where someone can express interest if they want to learn more?  If not, go to carrd.co and whip up a simple landing page.  Move fast and cheap. Don't worry about getting everything", "right.  Here's a great landing page example from Starter Story:   11. Learn how to drive traffic Once you have v1 of a landing page, then it's time to drive some traffic there.  Since you're already creating content for your primary social channel, why not start to drop that content in other places where people might be spending their time?  Places like:  Reddit Twitter LinkedIn Medium Hacker News IndieHackers Facebook groups Private Slack channels Etc. Every channel has its own algorithm and rules.  If you want to build a predictable, successful, and consistent content strategy, join 6,000+ students in my affordable course, The Content Operating System.   12. Start with a service business to learn more about your customers If you can generate enough impressions on your content and start growing a nice following, you can build a small service business.  A service business is usually defined as trading your time for money and providing a service.  There are 3 levels when building out your service business:  1) Level 1: Low-cost service business with the goal of learning and acquiring testimonials.  2) Level 2: An \"average cost\" service business where your goal is to focus your niche to a very particular client base that you serve best and...  3) Level 3: A high-cost service business where you provide incredible service to a micro-niche and charge top dollar.  13. Systematize your service growth The best process for moving through these 3 levels is called", "FITI:  Feedback: get feedback from clients. Iteration: use that feedback to improve your business. Testimonials: get testimonials to improve social proof. Increase: increase your prices the more testimonials you receive. One challenge of running a service business is how many manual tasks are required.  Make sure that you use low-cost, no-code (if you can't code) software tools to make your job easier.  Here are some of my favorites:  Website: Kajabi Scheduling: Calendly Content Publishing: HypeFury Payments: Stripe & Gumroad LinkedIn Analytics: Shield Website Analytics: Fathom Community Memberships: Outseta Customer Docs: Notion Notifications: Slack Customer CRM: Airtable Integrations: Zapier 14. Move to digital products Once you've niched down to your favorite customers and raised your rates, it's a great time to build out digital products that solve the common challenges you see other prospects having that either don't fit your niche or can't afford your services.  15. Timebox production If you want to create a good digital product, timebox your production to 21-28 days and help those prospects solve that one common challenge.  The more common challenges you find, the more short, time-boxed courses you can create.  16. Keep it short, simple, and focused on one outcome Remember, brevity is your friend.  Nobody wants to solve their problem in 10 hours.  Make your course 60-90 minutes and price it at a price that you think is reasonable and you would feel comfortable paying.  Make sure that the course is focused on solving one, big, problem your customers", "have talked to you about.  Don't guess!  Take a customer from point A to point B in 60-90 minutes and you'll have a satisfied group of paid students.  Next steps to start making money online In 2023, nobody should rely solely on a full-time income.  Fortunately, there's no shortage of ways to make online money.  You just need to pick something that interests you, take the first step, and stick with it.   Want to write and make good money doing it?  Write your first spec piece. Publish it on Medium. Share it on social media for the world to see.  Dream of opening an eCommerce store?  Create art. Take photos of it. List it on Etsy and see how things go.  Starting an online business requires some experimentation, so don't be afraid to fail and learn.  Need more inspiration and guidance? You may find my free guides and video courses useful.  That's it for now.  Get out there and turn those dreams into reality.", "Staring at a blank screen, racking our brains to come up with the perfect content to post \u2014 we've all been there.  It can be unnerving, especially if you're new to the game and trying to build an audience.  I faced similar challenges when I first started growing my social media presence. But after experimenting and learning what works, I've built a fan base of 750K+ followers across various platforms.   In this article, I'll let you in on how I create standout social media content that resonates with my target audience. I'll also discuss different content formats you should create to maximize your impact.  My hope is that these insights will help you elevate your social media content strategy in a fraction of the time it took me.  Let's get into it.  Tell your story Here's what most people do wrong:  They try to emulate others' success by rehashing their stories and ideas in hopes of going viral overnight.  Don't make this mistake.  Instead, bring a fresh, thought-provoking perspective to the table \u2014 one that only you can offer through your lens and personal experiences.  Share your story. Own it.

Social media content formats In the world of social media, variety is the spice of life.  Mixing up your content formats keeps your audience engaged and coming back for more.  Explore the following formats to create a dynamic and captivating feed:  Text-only posts Share your thoughts, insights, and stories in a concise, written format. These posts do really well on social media platforms like LinkedIn (and Twitter if they're shorter).  EXAMPLE:   Carousels Present a series of slides that tell a story or break down complex ideas. Many brilliant content creators share engaging carousels on LinkedIn and repurpose them on Instagram (if under 10 slides).  EXAMPLE: How to write incredibly persuasive copy with the AIDA model  Videos Capture attention with visual storytelling, tutorials, or behind-the-scenes glimpses. Videos are perfect for platforms like TikTok (short-form) and YouTube (long-form).  While not my go-to content type, video can be an awesome way to show your personality and build brand loyalty. There's a time and place for highly curated content, but people enjoy watching videos because they're often raw and relatable.  EXAMPLE: How to Grow & Monetize Your LinkedIn Audience   Blog articles", "Dive deeper into topics and give additional value through long-form content.  When writing a blog post, incorporate relevant keywords and phrases where it makes sense to help it rank on search engines.  I recommend publishing blogs on platforms like Medium or LinkedIn. If you have a business website, you can share relevant industry content there as well.  Pro tip: Use a canonical link when cross-posting articles on multiple sites. Canonical links let Google know you own the piece and what the original source is. This is the secret to boosting your post's reach without getting penalized for duplicate content.  EXAMPLE: Branding for Solopreneurs 101  Images and infographics Visualize data or concepts with eye-catching graphics that drive home your message. Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest are excellent for showcasing these visuals.  EXAMPLE:   \u200dRemember: What works best for one person may not work the same way for you.  So, don't be afraid to experiment with different formats and platforms to find the winning combination that resonates with your unique audience.  Types of social media content to create There are countless ways to cater to different preferences, spark discussions, and showcase your expertise. If you're starting out and not sure which types your followers will respond best to, I suggest rotating between 5-7 types to discover your sweet spot.   Explore 10 types of content to maintain a fresh presence:  1. Listicle Attention spans are short these days. Captivate your fans quickly with a good listicle. ", "Listicles break down complex ideas into easily digestible, numbered points. They're fantastic for conveying valuable insights in a concise, organized manner.  I've noticed that listicles grab attention and encourage engagement because they're scannable in seconds.  EXAMPLE:   2. Motivational People on social media want to learn from others who are where they want to be.  Motivate your audience with uplifting content like success stories, inspirational quotes, and personal experiences. These posts resonate with followers, fostering a sense of positivity and community.  I like to share motivational posts every now and then to build a supportive environment where people feel inspired to chase their dreams and overcome challenges.  Bonus: Blend inspiration with your knowledge to fire people up and show them the ropes.  EXAMPLE:   3. Observation Observational posts highlight interesting patterns, trends, or phenomena you've noticed in your niche. These posts invite your audience to think critically and engage in meaningful conversations.  Use observational posts as an opportunity to show thought leadership and encourage dialogue. This helps you establish a stronger connection with your audience and positions you as an industry expert.  EXAMPLE:   \u200d4. Actionable Actionable posts give your audience tangible steps, tips, or strategies they can apply to their lives or businesses.  I'm a fan of these because they deliver immediate value, helping followers solve problems and learn something new.  Similar to observational posts, actionable posts present a stellar opportunity to demonstrate your expertise and generosity. This fosters trust and loyalty", "among your audience while positioning you as the go-to resource in your niche.  EXAMPLE:   5. X vs. Y Comparison posts present a side-by-side analysis of two concepts, products, or strategies.  The goal of these is to help your audience understand the differences and make informed decisions. X vs. Y posts simplify complex choices for the reader.  EXAMPLE:   6. Contrarian Contrarian content questions widely accepted beliefs or practices.  Offer a fresh perspective that challenges the status quo. By presenting alternative viewpoints, you inspire people to think outside the box and partake in stimulating debates.  This is easily one of my favorite content types because it demonstrates intellectual curiosity and helps you stand out from the crowd. My engagement rate is through the roof every time I share a contrarian take.  EXAMPLE:   7. Analytical Analytical content explores data, trends, or results, offering your audience in-depth insights and valuable takeaways. These posts demonstrate your ability to dissect complex information or processes and make them accessible to your followers.  Now, analytical posts can be boring, so you'll want to present findings in a way that's easily scannable and digestible. A mix of bullet points, numbers, relevant graphics, and/or threads are good for this, depending on where you're publishing.  EXAMPLE: Breaking down how Anthony built a $100K side business in 12 months   8. Promotional We live in an attention economy. If you don't promote yourself, no one will.  As a solopreneur, it's on you", "to build brand awareness.  This is where promotional content comes in. It highlights your products, services, or accomplishments, inviting your audience to take action and engage with your brand.  While effective in generating leads and sales, too many promotional posts can come off as spammy and overwhelming to your followers. Maintain a balanced, value-driven approach to keep your audience excited about your offerings.  EXAMPLE: Black Friday Sale  9. Social proof An extension to promotional posts, social proof content showcases testimonials, reviews, or case studies from satisfied clients. These posts are powerful because they allow your audience to see the impact of your offerings through the lens of real-life success stories.  Sprinkling social proof posts once in a while helps build trust and confidence in your brand, making it easier for potential customers to take the leap and invest in you.  EXAMPLE:   10. Partnership (with other creators) Collaboration is vital for building a tight-knit community \u2014 and that's what social media is all about.  Partnership content involves teaming up with other creators, influencers, or industry experts. There are several ways to go about this, but I've been a podcast guest and participated in a few interviews.  Here's how it generally works:  Take part in the podcast feature or answer interview questions The podcast episode or interview goes live The host and I share the link on our social channels for fans to check out Working with other creators in your niche can provide fresh perspectives, expand", "your reach, and introduce your audience to new ideas. I love that it creates opportunities for mutual growth.  EXAMPLE: Podcast with Dan Koe - Justin Welsh Shows You How To Start & Grow A One-Person Business   Start creating social media content Social media can be challenging to navigate.  There's a lot to think about. Finding the right content ideas, keeping up with consistency, engagement\u2026 the list goes on.  Unfortunately, winging it won't get you far.  You need effective systems and strategies for long-term social media success.   Here are 6 key takeaways to keep in mind as you craft a robust social media plan:  Implement systems to make the content creation process easier and more efficient Establish a social media content calendar and schedule posts accordingly Share your expertise through content like actionable tips and analytical posts Connect with industry professionals and collaborate with other creators Use promotional content and social proof judiciously to build trust and credibility Refine your content strategy based on feedback, engagement, and metrics  If you're looking for more guidance on LinkedIn growth, you may find my course, The Operating System, helpful.

That\u2019s my overview of ways to craft compelling", "social media content.  Best of luck with your content marketing strategy.  \u200d", "A memorable social media presence is crucial for any one-person business.  But crafting a robust social media strategy can sometimes feel overwhelming and impossible.  Between managing content, engaging with your audience, and analyzing metrics, it's easy to feel like you're drowning in a sea of tasks.  Especially when you're doing it alone and have no strategy in place.  I've been there and know the struggle well.  So, I put together this practical guide to help you create a solopreneur social media strategy to attract more eyeballs to your business.  Master one social media platform first Harsh truth: Most people trying to build their online presence are spreading themselves too thin.  They're jumping from one platform to another, trying to be everywhere at once.  Ultimately, they get nowhere and wind up completely burnt out.  Don't be them.  Instead of trying to juggle multiple social media platforms, focus on mastering one first.  By concentrating on a single platform, you can dive deep into understanding its features, algorithms, and audience preferences.  This laser-focused approach will allow you to create high-quality, tailored content that resonates with your target audience.  The result?  Faster growth and more meaningful connections.  So, before we dive into the strategy, take a step back and evaluate which platform aligns best with your:  Business goals Target audience Personal strengths Once you've nailed that, give it your all and watch your online presence skyrocket. Then, and only then, consider expanding to other", "on mastering one first.

Then, and only then, consider expanding to other platforms.  Remember: It's better to excel in one place than to be mediocre everywhere.  Creating a social media strategy for solopreneurs Identify your target audience Choose your primary platform Set clear, measurable goals Create a content strategy Develop a consistent brand voice Establish a distinct visual identity Engage with your audience Analyze and optimize Step #1: Identify your target audience Knowing your target audience is the first step to coming up with an effective social media strategy.  It's the foundation for everything else.  Before creating content or even picking a platform, get crystal clear on who you're trying to reach:  Demographics Gather basic information about your ideal customer or follower.  How old are they? Where do they live? Are they male or female? What's their income level? What do they do for a living? Having these details in mind will help you create content that appeals to those most likely", "to be interested in your product or service.  Likes and dislikes Dive deeper into your target audience's likes, dislikes, hobbies, and interests.  What kind of content do they like to consume? Which influencers do they follow? What are their favorite brands? Understanding these preferences enable you to produce content that speaks directly to their interests.  Pain points and challenges Get inside your audience's head and identify the problems they're facing.  What questions are they asking? What are their biggest obstacles? How can you help solve their problems? By addressing these pain points in your content, you'll position yourself as a valuable resource and someone who truly understands customer needs.  Online behavior Analyze how people in your niche interact online.  Which social media platforms do they prefer? Do they prefer photo, video, or text content? When are they most active? These answers will help you adapt your strategy to reach them more effectively.  To gather this information, you can use a combination of market research, surveys, and social media analytics tools.  One of my favorite ways to learn about my ideal customer is simply by interacting with them online and asking about their preferences and challenges.  Step #2: Choose your primary platform As discussed earlier, focusing on one primary social media platform is the secret sauce to building a strong online presence as a solopreneur.  But how do you choose the right platform for your business?  Here are some factors I considered when making this critical", "decision:  Audience alignment There's no point in investing time and effort into a platform where your ideal customers or followers are few and far between.  Do some research to find out where they spend time online. Make that platform your primary focus.  This could be Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, TikTok, or LinkedIn, to name a few.  I started on LinkedIn in 2019 and found that people really resonated with my content there. After a few years of building my presence, I branched out to Twitter.   If you want to see the exact system I used to go from 2k to 400k+ followers and $4M+ in income with zero paid ads, check out The LinkedIn Operating System.  Content format Different platforms cater to different content formats.  For example, Instagram is all about visuals.  Twitter thrives on snappy text updates.  People like to go to TikTok for short, entertaining videos.  Consider the type of content you enjoy creating and are good at producing. Then, pick a platform that aligns with your strengths.  Business goals Your primary platform should also support your business objectives.  If your goal is to drive website traffic, a platform like Pinterest could be a great fit.  But if you're looking to build brand awareness, Instagram or TikTok could be the way to go.  Competitive landscape Analyze your competition and see where they're most active.  It's important to be present where your competitors are. But also consider platforms where", "there's less competition and more opportunities to stand out.  This was actually one of the ways I grew so fast on LinkedIn.  I saw that people weren't doing what I was doing, so I doubled down on it.  The rest is history.  Ease of use and resources Time and resources are precious for solopreneurs.  Choose a platform you're comfortable using and make sure it doesn't require a steep learning curve or expensive tools to manage.  This way, you'll be able to hit the ground running.  Step #3: Set clear, measurable goals Let's be real: Without clear, measurable goals, your social media marketing efforts will be like shooting in the dark.  You might hit the target occasionally, but you'll waste heaps of time and energy along the way.  Let's talk about setting goals that will keep you focused, motivated, and on track to achieve the success you deserve.   Specific Your goals should be well-defined and leave no room for ambiguity.  Instead of setting a vague goal like \"increase engagement,\" go for something more concrete like \"increase the average number of comments per post by 25% in 3 months.\"  Measurable To track your progress and know when you've achieved your goals, they must be quantifiable.  Measure your success with metrics like:  Likes Shares Followers Comments Email signups Website traffic Leads generated Achievable While it's great to aim high, setting unrealistic goals can be demoralizing and counterproductive.  Make your goals challenging yet attainable,", "considering your available resources and the current state of your social media presence.  Relevant Craft your social media goals around your business objectives.  If your primary goal is generating leads, focus on social media goals that support that. This may include growing your email list or driving traffic to your website.  Time-bound Give your goals a definitive deadline. Having that sense of urgency keeps you accountable.  Deadlines have helped me prioritize tasks, stay focused, and maintain momentum.  Step #4: Create a content strategy Your content strategy is the blueprint for consistent, high-impact content. It keeps you organized and laser-focused on delivering value to your audience.  I suggest developing a content roadmap that outlines the:  Types of content you'll create Topics you'll cover Posting frequency What types of content should I create? Consider a mix of promotional, educational, and engaging content to keep your audience interested and coming back for more.   This could include blog posts, videos, images, podcasts, or live streams.  Pick the ones that work best on your primary platform.  For me, that's text-only posts on LinkedIn. But recently, I've been seeing more people create and share videos there as well.  For more information on building a better, faster content production system, check out The Content Operating System and join over 6,000 students.  What topics should I cover? The themes to cover in your content should match your target audience's interests and pain points and also your business offerings.  For example,", "if you're a fitness coach, your content themes could be:  Workout tips Industry trends Nutrition advice Client testimonials Motivational stories Pro tip: Aim for a good balance between promotional and non-promotional posts.  When in doubt, follow the 80/20 rule.  80% of your content should be educational or entertaining. The remaining 20% can be promotional.  With this approach, you'll build rapport with your audience and avoid coming across as overly salesy.  How often should a solopreneur post on social media? As a general rule of thumb, I tell people to go for consistency over quantity.  It's better to put out high-quality content every time you post than to overwhelm yourself by trying to post daily.  For example, you might start with a content calendar of 3 posts per week. From there, you can adjust your schedule based on your results and capacity.   Step #5: Develop a consistent brand voice Chances are, you've seen a post online and thought, \"I knew this was written by so-and-so before I even saw their name attached to it.\"  This is what you should be striving for when writing social media content.  Your brand voice is more than just the words you use.  It's personality, tone, and style that infuse every piece of content you create.  A consistent brand voice not only helps you stand out from the competition but also fosters a connection with your audience.  To develop your own brand voice, ask yourself these questions: ", "How do I want others to perceive me and my brand? Am I authoritative and professional, or casual and approachable? Do I want to be witty and entertaining, or serious and informative? Think about the image you want to project, then choose 3-5 adjectives that best describe your brand personality.  Step #6: Establish a distinct visual identity A picture is worth a thousand words. And in the world of social media, a strong visual identity can make all the difference.  Your visual identity is the collection of colors, fonts, images, and design elements that represent your brand and set you apart from the competition.  Here are some things to think about when coming up with your visual style:  Set the stage Consider your brand's personality and the emotions you want to evoke with your visuals.  Are you going for a bold, modern look or a warm, vintage vibe?  Think about what your target market would like to see and how your visual style can connect with them more deeply.  Choose your color palette Colors not only evoke emotions but also help reinforce your brand's personality.  Choose 2-3 primary colors and 1-2 accent colors that work with your brand. Then, use these colors consistently across all your content and marketing materials.  Select your fonts Typography plays a significant role in communicating your brand's message.  Choose 1-2 fonts that complement your brand's personality and are easy to read. Stick to these fonts for all your content, from social", "media captions to blog posts.  Create branded templates Save time and maintain consistency by making branded templates for your social media posts, blog images, and other marketing materials.  Then, use your chosen color palette, fonts, and design elements to make templates that you can easily customize for various content types and topics.  For example, if you go to the newsletter section of my website, you'll see that all the featured images have a uniform look:   This makes my brand more recognizable and memorable.  Step #7: Engage with your audience Engagement is the name of the social media game.  It's not enough to simply post content and hope for the best.  You need to actively engage with people to build authentic relationships, foster loyalty, and create a thriving online community.  Here are some ways I make my audience feel valued and heard (and you can too):  Respond to comments and messages Make it a priority to respond to comments and messages from your audience in a timely manner.  Whether it's answering a question, addressing a concern, or simply expressing gratitude for their support, your personal touch will go a long way in building trust.  Ask for feedback and opinions Show your audience that you value their thoughts by actively seeking their input.  Ask questions in your social media captions, create polls, or host Q&A sessions to encourage engagement.  This is also a fantastic way to gather valuable insights that can help you improve", "your content and offerings.  Keep the conversation going Don't let the engagement end with a single comment or message.  Continue the conversation by asking follow-up questions, sharing additional resources, or simply showing genuine interest in people's thoughts and experiences.   Step #8: Analyze and optimize In the ever-evolving landscape of social media, staying ahead of the curve requires constant strategy analysis and optimization.  Every quarter, I like to reflect and study what worked well (and what didn't). From there, I'll adjust my strategy to get more wins next quarter.  Keep in mind that what works for one person may not work for you. So, don't be afraid to find your groove by testing new ideas and content formats.  By adopting an analytical and iterative mindset, you'll set yourself up for continuous growth and success on social media.  Get started with social media as a solopreneur In summary, having a strong social media presence is essential for solopreneurs and small businesses.  The good news is:  There's no shortage of tactics to build a powerful social media strategy.  You just need to identify your goals, understand your audience, and stay committed to the process.  Want to grow your online presence and attract a loyal community?  Curate compelling content. Share it consistently across your platforms. Engage with your audience and build real connections.  Want to be a thought leader in your niche?  Establish your personal brand. Share valuable insights and experiences. Participate in relevant online", "community discussions and make your voice heard.  Mastering social media requires some experimentation. So, don't be afraid to test, learn, and adapt.  Need more inspiration and guidance?  You may find my courses, The Operating System and The Content Operating System, helpful.  I hope you found this helpful.  Now get out there and turn your social media presence into a money-making machine.  \u200d", "In the world of entrepreneurship, if you take your foot off the gas, you don't stay neutral.  You move in reverse.  You always need to be learning and taking action.  But the conventional approach to learning has us clinging onto friends, peers, colleagues, bosses, experts, influencers, and anyone else we think might lead us to the promised land.  We sit, waiting to be spoon-fed the \"secrets\" to success.  But that doesn't work.  I remember when I started as a solopreneur, feeling completely overwhelmed by the amount of stuff I'd need to know to run a basic business.  Everyone I talked to seemed to have a golden path, but their advice usually left me stuck in the same place, waiting for someone else to unlock the doors of wisdom.  I learned a pretty important lesson in that first year:  It's critical to take control of our learning and steer ourselves toward success.  It's the opposite of traditional business culture that conditions us to ask permission, wait our turn, stay in line, and eventually be told what to do. That kind of culture is stagnant and frustrating. And it's the opposite of how you'll need to act as a solopreneur or entrepreneur.  It's called being \"auto-didactic\": having self-determination and enthusiasm for learning on your own.  And it's never been more important.  Choose what to learn, set your own pace, and tailor the learning experience to your specific needs. No more waiting in line for someone", "steer ourselves toward success.

Because time is your most valuable asset, you can't waste it.  You might ask, \"Can I teach myself everything?\" No, probably not everything. But you'll be amazed by how much you can learn independently.  When I started writing on LinkedIn in 2018, nobody was using it like they do today.  I thought that was a massive opportunity, so I taught myself how to use LinkedIn like a content creator and turned it into the LinkedIn operating system that 23,000 people use today.  When I couldn't figure out how to generate revenue from my content, I experimented for 6 months until I created a complete content operating system that still drives my business revenue today.  The satisfaction of mastering these skills or overcoming a business challenge on your own is f*cking awesome.  It builds a sense of confidence, self-reliance, creativity, and determination that", "no corporate job will ever teach you.  I'm not saying there's no value in the corporate learning structure. There is. But those methods only get you so far. When you're out on your own, conservative learning habits must be squashed.  In a world that's constantly changing, waiting for someone else to teach you means you move in reverse. You get left behind.  So, are you ready to step out of the shadows of conventional learning and embrace the power of auto-didacticism?  There's never been a better time to start than today.  Find something you want to learn. Be proactive. Be resourceful. Be determined to find the answer on your own.

Social media Besides LinkedIn, you can choose the social media platforms that best align with your target audience and industry.  This could be Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and/or YouTube, to name a few.  I suggest you pick one initially and start growing a loyal following. Once you have an audience there, slowly expand your reach on other platforms.  Wherever you go, focus on building a consistent and engaging presence, sharing valuable content, and interacting with your followers.  Website After establishing your footing on social media, create a professional and user-friendly website that showcases your services, portfolio, and testimonials.  Make sure it's easy to navigate, mobile-responsive, and optimized for search engines.  Building a beautiful yet functional website doesn't have to be complicated or expensive.

I love that it enables me to manage everything in one place, but it's", "a hefty (and probably unnecessary) investment for newer solopreneurs.   2. Network with others in your industry Building meaningful connections with like-minded professionals in your industry is essential.  Networking can open doors to new opportunities, collaborations, and valuable insights that can help you grow your business.  Here are a few ways I enjoy networking:  Join online communities Engage in industry-specific forums, social media groups, and discussion boards where you can share your knowledge, exchange ideas, and learn from others in your field.  I belong to a few public communities as well as some private communities with my friends and other solopreneurs.  Collaborate on projects Seek out opportunities to work with other professionals in your industry. This doesn't have to mean a paid gig.  Joint ventures and partnerships can help you expand your reach, learn new skills, and add value to your offerings.  One of my favorite ways to collaborate is as a podcast guest. I get to have inspiring conversations with incredible people, share my story, and get my business out there.  Build relationships Instead of just collecting contacts, focus on building genuine relationships with the people you meet.   Offer to help and support them when you can, and don't be afraid to ask for advice when you need it.  After working for myself for five years, I've learned this:  One of the best ways to grow is to learn from those smarter than you.  3. Create a memorable visual identity A", "distinctive visual identity helps you stand out from your competition and leaves a lasting impression on your audience.  Your visual identity should reflect your brand's personality and connect with your target customers.  Consider the following elements to craft a memorable visual identity:  Logo Design a unique and eye-catching logo that captures the essence of your brand. It doesn't need to be complex.  Make it versatile enough to work across various platforms and formats, from your website to business cards and social media profiles.  Color palette Choose a color scheme that represents your brand's values and appeals to your target audience.  Reinforce your brand identity by using the same colors across all of your marketing materials and online presence.  Typography Select fonts that align with your brand and are easily readable. Stick to 2-3 font styles to maintain consistency and avoid visual clutter.  Imagery Use high-quality images and graphics that complement your brand's message. A consistent visual style creates a cohesive look and feel across your marketing assets.  4. Showcase your expertise with compelling content Put yourself in the shoes of your buyer.  You'd only want to buy from someone who demonstrated credibility and know-how in what they do, right?   Sharing valuable and engaging content is a fantastic way to show what you know and build trust with prospective buyers.  By consistently publishing insightful content, you'll become an authority in your field and create opportunities for growth.  Here's how I showcase my expertise:", " Engage with your audience Community is huge when it comes to branding.  Build yours by encouraging feedback, questions, and comments from your audience.  A great way to do this is by closing off a post with either a question or a call to action, to initiate a response from readers.  Besides posting your own content, you should also leave thoughtful comments on other people's posts.  Don't worry; this doesn't have to be as time-consuming as it sounds.  Create a Notion board with 3 lists of 5 people each:  People with a similar following count (they're more likely to engage back on your content) Larger creators (more people will see your comments) Industry professionals (let prospects know you exist without sending tacky cold pitches) Once you have your lists, set aside 15 minutes each day to engage with these people.  With time, your audience will grow and get to know what you're all about.  Create a content plan Needing to make noise every day gets exhausting for many new business owners.  In my 5 years of solopreneurship, I've certainly had days where I'm less motivated. But I learned that having a content strategy goes a long way in helping me overcome those days.  Basically, a content strategy outlines your goals, target audience, and the types of content you'll create.  This plan serves as a roadmap for your content creation efforts and ensures consistency in your messaging.  When you have this plan in front of", "you, it becomes much easier to conquer writer's block.   A content calendar may look something like this:  Monday: Share industry-related practical tips and insights Tuesday: Highlight a testimonial or recent case study showing results you brought a client Wednesday: Promote your business (e.g., your offering, newsletter, podcast feature) Thursday: Start a conversation about an industry hot-take or opinion Friday: A personal story that taught you an important business lesson Everyone's content strategy is different.  So, get creative with yours and do what makes the most sense for your business.  Choose the right formats Similar to content strategy, the best content formats are different for everyone. Don't be afraid to experiment with multiple to see what best resonates with your audience.  I've learned that my audience enjoys short-form text posts on LinkedIn and Twitter. But I also publish informative blog posts and newsletter content on my website at least once a week.  Start by teaching people what you know via various mediums, then narrow it down based on the feedback you receive:  Videos Podcasts Carousels Blog posts Infographics Social media updates Short-form text posts For more information on building a better, faster content production system, check out The Content Operating System and join over 6,000 students.  5. Tell stories to connect with your audience Storytelling is a powerful way to emotionally connect with your audience and make your brand more relatable.  I take my audience on my solopreneurial journey by being open about my wins and losses.", " By sharing my progress, experiences, and insights, I build trust with my audience and inspire them to take their first step.  Here's how you might leverage storytelling in your branding and content:  Share your origin story Your origin story is the bedrock of your brand. It helps your audience understand what drives and motivates you.  Did you notice a gap in the market and decide to fill it with an innovative product?  How did you go about doing so?  Talk about it.  You\u2019ll be surprised at how many people you inspire by telling your story.  Highlight client success stories Did you just help your client increase sales by 38% this month?  Invite your audience to celebrate with you!  Illustrate the impact of your work by sharing case studies or testimonials from satisfied clients.  These stories will not only demonstrate the value of your services but also help prospects envision how you can help them achieve similar results.  Be genuine and vulnerable  Don't be afraid to share your struggles and failures.  We all go through them in some form at every stage of life.  There's something extremely humanizing about vulnerability and your audience will connect with you on a more personal level.  6. Deliver value and exceptional customer experiences Overdelivering is one of the quickest ways to build a solid reputation and lucrative business.  By consistently exceeding expectations, your clients will gain confidence in you and your abilities.  The", "result of unwavering trust and loyalty?  Those clients will happily refer you to people in their network who need your product or service.  Before you know it, you've built yourself a mighty word-of-mouth machine.  Here are my favorite ways to deliver value and exceptional experiences:  Understand your client's needs First, you need to understand your client's pain points, goals, and expectations.  Who exactly are they looking to work with?  What do they want to see happen?  How can you help them achieve their goals?  Getting clear answers to these questions will help you tailor your solutions to address their specific needs and deliver maximum value.  Go above and beyond Exceeding your client's expectations doesn't need to take up a lot of your time.  Let's say you get hired to write a blog post based on a provided outline. But as you write it, you notice the client missed an important point worth making.  Take it upon yourself to fill in the gaps, showing you have stellar judgment and work well with little to no handholding.  Be responsive and accessible I've worked with a bunch of companies, and many of them share a common struggle:  Finding reliable solopreneurs and freelancers.  Oftentimes, projects fall through the cracks because those involved respond too late or completely fail to deliver.  Don't be them.  Make it easy for your clients to reach you by providing multiple communication channels (e.g., Slack and email) and responding quickly", "to messages. This demonstrates your commitment to their success; they'll know they can always count on you.  Next steps for your solopreneur brand Building an unforgettable brand from scratch can feel overwhelming at first, especially if you're new to solopreneurship.  Nobody is achieving long-term success by flying by the seat of their pants.  The most successful business owners have effective systems in place.  To start building your brand, do the following:  Identify your unique selling proposition (USP) and what you'll be known for Build an online presence on a platform like LinkedIn Optimize your profile (if you choose LinkedIn) Share your expertise through compelling content Network with industry professionals Wow your clients with unmatched value and experiences Continuously refine your brand based on feedback If you need more guidance on LinkedIn growth, you may enjoy The LinkedIn Operating System, a course I developed which has so far supported 15,000+ students get discovered on the platform.

That's it for now.  Thanks for reading.  ", "We live in a world that's obsessed with certificates, diplomas, and structured learning.  The kind of learning that's neatly packaged into college degrees or training programs.  But what if the traditional ways that we've approached learning and education, especially in business, are flawed?  A More Unconventional Path I remember sitting in training sessions at work, listening to \"experts\" talking about business strategies, marketing tactics, and growth models.  They were reciting from the same old playbook, but something always felt off to me.  I can vividly remember a board member at my last startup telling me that my salespeople should travel on planes to go prospect - we sold a product that was $6,000. I couldn't help but smirk.  And I can clearly recall looking around the room and thinking, \"Am I the only one feeling this way?\"  It wasn't long after that I started realizing something: real learning doesn't always come in neat packages.  We learn the most when we start doing things, not hearing or reading things. Even when the teacher has \"been there, done that\", the advice given doesn't always work. Why?  Because conventional wisdom isn't always wise.  The Skeptic's Guide to Learning So, what does learning look like when we throw conventional wisdom out the window?  Here's what I've come up with:  Question Everything: Don't accept something just because \"that's how it's always been done\". Dig deeper, challenge assumptions, and don't be afraid to ask \"Why?\" Often, the stuff being taught", "always come in neat packages.

Here's what I've come up with:  Question Everything: Don't accept something just because \"that's how it's always been done\". Dig deeper, challenge assumptions, and don't be afraid to ask \"Why?\" Often, the stuff being taught is 5, 10, or even 20 years old. Use Trial and Error: Failure can be one hell of a teacher. I've made tons of mistakes, and I've learned more from them than from any classroom lesson. Your journey will look different than other people's. So make your own mistakes and learn your own lessons. Find Your Own Path: Find mentors, read books, take online courses, and experiment. But you can't just seek out knowledge - you must put it into action. Create your unique learning journey by testing, analyzing, iterating, and repeating. Integrate Learning into Life: Outside of mentors, books, and online courses, make sure that you integrate learning into your daily work. Don't think of learning and working as separate. They are the same! So make sure you're setting up systems to capture what you learn as you put in the work. Changing the Culture This approach isn't easy.  It's often met with skepticism,", "or \"trust me, the old way works.\"  But it's worth asking - are you satisfied with the status quo around learning and development? Are you content with simply going through the motions of another workshop or training program?  There's a better way. A way that incorporates individuality, curiosity, and the entrepreneurial spirit that drives each of us.  It's about owning your learning, taking control, and not being dedicated to the best practices of the business world.  Instead, maybe it's time you created your own best practices?  In Summary The conventional learning path may be comfortable, but I don't find it useful. I didn't learn how to build a business by reading about it or listening to stories.  Instead, I found that stepping out of my comfort zone and embracing a different approach to learning worked really well for me: Doing stuff and watching what happened.  So, maybe it's time you started asking some questions, challenging the status quo, taking action, and learning on your own terms.  The best investment we can make is in ourselves, in our own way.  And you know what? Your specific journey will always be one worth taking.", "The #1 reason why solopreneurs never get traction with their online business is they aren\u2019t focused on a specific customer.  Instead, they are wildly unfocused.  I want to teach you 3 different methods to \u201cfind your niche\u201d and target a specific audience with a specific problem.  A problem you can solve.   3 ways to choose your niche Choosing a sub-niche by audience Choosing a sub-niche by product or service Creating your own \"niche of one\" Method 1: Choosing a sub-niche by audience A sub-niche is a smaller subsection of a broad audience. Generally, it works like this:  Broad audience \u2192 niche \u2192 sub-niche  You can apply this formula to the audience you\u2019re looking to attract.  For example, let\u2019s say you're a personal trainer looking to build an online coaching business.  Rather than targeting athletes (broad audience), or runners (niche), you could focus specifically on marathon runners (sub-niche).  This example assumes you have deep knowledge of marathon running and can speak intelligently about the topic.  Method 2: Choosing a sub-niche by product or service You can also apply this to the product or service that you are creating to arrive at your audience.  Instead of your product being a book (broad product), or a cookbook (niche), you could focus specifically on creating a vegan dessert cookbook (sub-niche).  Or, rather than offering a generic service such as coaching (broad service), or leadership coaching (niche), you could focus specifically on leadership coaching for female entrepreneurs (sub-niche).", " This example assumes you have deep knowledge of marathon running and can speak intelligently about the topic.  Method 2: Choosing a sub-niche by product or service You can also apply this to the product or service that you are creating to arrive at your audience.  Instead of your product being a book (broad product), or a cookbook (niche), you could focus specifically on creating a vegan dessert cookbook (sub-niche).  Or, rather than offering a generic service such as coaching (broad service), or leadership coaching (niche), you could focus specifically on leadership coaching for female entrepreneurs (sub-niche).  The result?  Once you narrow down to a sub-niche, your audience is more likely to have the same challenges, and therefore the same wants and needs.  That\u2019s where you come in.  Now what?  Once you\u2019ve narrowed it down to your sub-niche audience, you can start learning more about them.  Where do they hang out online? What jargon and language do they use? What podcasts and YouTube channels do they watch? Who is already serving this audience i.e. who are your competitors? Method 3: Creating your own \"niche of one\" The most compelling creators online are, what I call, a niche of one.  A niche of one is a unique combination of skills and interests rolled into one idea and then distributed through highly creative or technical content.  When you do this well, you own a micro-niche.  You become the category creator. The best in show. The only.", " And you can deliver products and services that people will pay for.  If you want to do this well, you need to understand the formula and the 6 building blocks behind a niche of one.   I\u2019ll break them down and then put them back together in the hopes that it helps you become a more compelling creator.  How to create your \u201cNiche of One\u201d Pick something you excel at Choose something you're interested in Combine them Create a distribution system Allow an audience to form Ask them what they need 1. Skills: Something you excel at Most skills, by themselves, are not unique.  Lots of people can write, speak English and Portuguese, or do financial analysis.  Too often, people make the mistake of choosing a skill when deciding to create online. I\u2019m a writer, so I\u2019ll write. I\u2019m a painter, so I\u2019ll paint. I know how to do X, so I\u2019ll teach people how to do X. You get the point.  The difficulty arises when the inevitable question comes up:  \u201cWhat do I write about today?\u201d \u201cWhat do I paint today?\" \u201cWhat do I teach today?\u201d   When the brain faces a creative block, people either quit creating or create something subpar. Two poor outcomes.  Let\u2019s introduce interests into the equation and see what happens.  2. Interests: What you're passionate about This guide is not meant to be cliche. \u201cChase your dreams!\u201d. \u201cDo something you love and you\u2019ll never work a day in your", "life!\u201d That's all nonsense.  But, interests are important. They keep us...well\u2026interested.  Maybe you're fluent in English and Portuguese and you\u2019re extremely well-versed in marketing. Maybe you understand financial analysis and your hobby is high-end wine.  When you read those sentences, nothing unique or compelling really jumps out. So, now what?  Let\u2019s put them together to start formulating an interesting idea.  3. Idea: Combine the above two The idea block of a niche of one is where most people get it wrong. They let a lack of creativity keep them from building something unique.  For example, we\u2019ve all had ideas before, but they end up as unfinished blog posts, abandoned podcasts, or dwindling YouTube channels.  That\u2019s because the creation must be forced. You\u2019re starting from a blank canvas every morning. We\u2019re back to the same old questions:  \u201cWhat do I write about today?\u201d \u201cWhat do I paint today?\" \u201cWhat do I teach today?\u201d  In a niche of one, you create one idea, and then learn how to say it, do it, or package it 1,000+ different ways.  Let\u2019s use our examples from above.  Example #1: You\u2019re a financial analyst and your interest is in wine.  Unique idea: Use your financial knowledge to project the value of one high-end wine bottle each morning.   Example #2: You're fluent in English and Portuguese and your interest is in marketing.  Unique idea: Translate one of your favorite company landing pages from English to Portuguese using local", "dialect and slang, every day.   You could easily argue that these ideas are not interesting, but you\u2019d be missing the larger point. They are one single idea that can be produced and reproduced 1000x over.  The game of \u201cwhat do I do today?\u201d is now over.  These ideas, when shared broadly through proper distribution, attract a natural audience of interested people.  4/5. Distribution & Audience: Create a distribution system In order for people to discover your unique and interesting idea, they have to be able to find it. This is where distribution comes into play.  Your audience is an outcome of good distribution.  Having a niche of one gives you an advantage because you\u2019ve increased the number of places you can distribute.  For example, if you\u2019re our financial whiz/wine lover, you can distribute on sites centered around wine, the wine exchange, finance trends, etc.  I\u2019d recommend focusing on the following:  Personal blog or newsletter: a place where your content can live forever and can be a catch-all for email subscribers. Social media: pick one channel and master it. Don\u2019t try to be a social media hero from the start. Industry sites: every skill and interest has industry sites. For example, I like to talk about building online, so I can find great channels on IndieHackers. Slack Channels: join private Slack communities centered around your skills or interests. By distributing routinely, a natural audience will grow.  Remember, you don\u2019t pick your audience, they pick you. You", "simply set up a system where more people are likely to find you.   If you\u2019re our finance/wine person from above, you will naturally attract an audience of people who love wine, sommeliers, and collectors.  But, you\u2019re also likely to attract people who have an interest in data analysis, financial trends, the market, exchanges, and so on.  6. Product: Ask your audience what they need Now comes the easiest part. Asking and listening.  With an audience built around a specific, unique idea, you can simply start to ask them what would be most helpful, and listen to their answers.  It\u2019s amazing how many people skip this critical step.  Ask on social or send out a survey via email. What would they like to learn? What would they be happy to spend some money on?  For example, some people might enjoy a digital course teaching them your method behind wine price projections.  Others might want a 1:1 Zoom call where you apply your formula to bottles in their collection together, while some would likely just want to purchase a financial analysis of multiple bottles, without the video call.  All of this can be placed on a value ladder that people can move up over time:   Summary In summary, the internet is getting crowded.  Picking your passion and then trying to write or record from scratch each day can be a very daunting task.  The most compelling creators you see online have a system. Nobody", "is out here winging it.  So, to get started, do the following:  Pick something you excel at Choose something you're interested in Combine them Create a distribution system Allow an audience to form Ask them what they need That's all for my guide on choosing a profitable niche.  Thanks for reading.  ", "For many years, I was nothing more than a spectator in the world of entrepreneurship.  While I watched my friends build their brands and transform them into successful businesses, I remained on the sidelines, paralyzed by the fear of the unknown.  Up until 2018, I had never put pen to paper or fingers to keyboard to share my thoughts online.  Why?  The answer was simple, but also very complex: fear.  I was terrified of putting myself out there. The scenarios I imagined were pretty intimidating:  Scorn Ridicule Mocking Embarrassment I look back and still don't think these fears were entirely unfounded.  Some of them did happen.  But as time went on, they became blips on my radar, fading into the background of this journey marked by growth and discovery. When I talk to my wife about nasty comments and trolls, I can't even remember who they were or what they said.  There's a lesson in there.  The Leap to Action It's easy to read about starting something. It's natural to dream about it. It's even common to make elaborate plans to get started.  But none of that compares to the simple, powerful act of just starting.  When we allow our fears to dictate our actions, we miss out on big opportunities.  The worst thing that happens when we take a chance is that our life stays the same. But the best thing? Our life changes for good, forever.  So, how do you", "what they said.

The worst thing that happens when we take a chance is that our life stays the same. But the best thing? Our life changes for good, forever.  So, how do you actually start? What's the tactical plan for moving from dreamer to doer?  Here are two steps that helped me.  Two Action Steps to Get Started Today 1. Map Your Fear Landscape Write down your specific fears and anxieties about putting yourself out there. Next to each, write down a rational response or a way to overcome that fear.  Sometimes, simply acknowledging these fears can diminish their power over you.  For example: \"I'm afraid that someone will say something nasty to me\" is reframed to: \"For every person who says something nasty, it's likely that 99 will say something kind.\"  2. Set a 30-Day Challenge with Public Accountability Commit to a small daily action related to your goal for the next 30 days. Share this commitment with a friend, family member, or in public on social media.  Public accountability will motivate you and keep you on track.  For example: Erwan", "Lier decided to finally put himself out there when he read a Tweet of mine about growing on Twitter. It's changed his whole life in 60 days.   The Path Forward The path of the solopreneur is filled with unique challenges and occasional setbacks.  But it also offers the potential for something truly remarkable. A chance to build something of your own, express your ideas and creativity, and make a meaningful impact on others.  Why not you? Why not today?  You have the power to change your life. And you don't need to wait for a perfect moment or a sign from the universe. The right time is now, and the person to do it is you.  So, stop reading about starting. Stop dreaming about starting. Stop planning to get started. Just start. Your future self will thank you.
